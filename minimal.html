<li>$n \to n/2$ ($n$ is even)</li>
<li>$n \to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)</li></ul>
<p>Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:
$$13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1.$$</p>
<p>It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.</p>

<h1>Problem 20</h1>
<p>$n!$ means $n \times (n - 1) \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$.</p>
<p>For example, $10! = 10 \times 9 \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800$,<br>and the sum of the digits in the number $10!$ is $3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27$.</p>
<p>Find the sum of the digits in the number $100!$.</p>


<h1>Problem 21</h1>
<p>Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$).<br>
If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \ne b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.</p>
<p>For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.</p>
<p>Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.</p>

<h1>Problem 22</h1>
<p>Using <a href="resources/documents/0022_names.txt">names.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.</p>
<p>For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938$th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \times 53 = 49714$.</p>
<p>What is the total of all the name scores in the file?</p>


<h1>Problem 23</h1>
<p>A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of $28$ would be $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$, which means that $28$ is a perfect number.</p>
<p>A number $n$ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$.</p>

<p>As $12$ is the smallest abundant number, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is $24$. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than $28123$ can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.</p>

<p>The number, $1406357289$, is a $0$ to $9$ pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits $0$ to $9$ in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.</p>
<p>Let $d_1$ be the $1$<sup>st</sup> digit, $d_2$ be the $2$<sup>nd</sup> digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:</p>
<ul><li>$d_2d_3d_4=406$ is divisible by $2$</li>
<li>$d_3d_4d_5=063$ is divisible by $3$</li>
<li>$d_4d_5d_6=635$ is divisible by $5$</li>
<li>$d_5d_6d_7=357$ is divisible by $7$</li>
<li>$d_6d_7d_8=572$ is divisible by $11$</li>
<li>$d_7d_8d_9=728$ is divisible by $13$</li>
<li>$d_8d_9d_{10}=289$ is divisible by $17$</li>
</ul><p>Find the sum of all $0$ to $9$ pandigital numbers with this property.</p>


<h1>Problem 44</h1>
<p>Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P_n=n(3n-1)/2$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
$$1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, \dots$$</p>
<p>It can be seen that $P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8$. However, their difference, $70 - 22 = 48$, is not pentagonal.</p>
<p>Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $P_j$ and $P_k$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $D = |P_k - P_j|$ is minimised; what is the value of $D$?</p>

<h1>Problem 46</h1>
<p>It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.</p>
\begin{align}
9 = 7 + 2 \times 1^2\\
15 = 7 + 2 \times 2^2\\
21 = 3 + 2 \times 3^2\\
25 = 7 + 2 \times 3^2\\
27 = 19 + 2 \times 2^2\\
33 = 31 + 2 \times 1^2

<p>It turns out that the conjecture was false.</p>

<p>Find the last ten digits of the series, $1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + \cdots + 1000^{1000}$.</p>


<h1>Problem 49</h1>
<p>The arithmetic sequence, $1487, 4817, 8147$, in which each of the terms increases by $3330$, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the $4$-digit numbers are permutations of one another.</p>
<p>There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three $1$-, $2$-, or $3$-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other $4$-digit increasing sequence.</p>
<p>What $12$-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?</p>


<h1>Problem 50</h1>
<p>The prime $41$, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:</p>
$$41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.$$
<p>This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.</p>

<h1>Problem 51</h1>
<p>By replacing the 1<sup>st</sup> digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.</p>
<p>By replacing the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.</p>

<h1>Problem 53</h1>
<p>There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:</p>
<p class="center">123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345</p>
<p>In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 = 10$.</p>
<p>In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r \le n$, $n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$, and $0! = 1$.

<p>It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\displaystyle \binom {23} {10} = 1144066$.</p>
<p>How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n r$ for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?</p>

<h1>Problem 54</h1>
<p>In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:</p>
<ul><li><b>High Card</b>: Highest value card.</li>
<li><b>One Pair</b>: Two cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Two Pairs</b>: Two different pairs.</li>
<li><b>Three of a Kind</b>: Three cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Straight</b>: All cards are consecutive values.</li>
<li><b>Flush</b>: All cards of the same suit.</li>
<li><b>Full House</b>: Three of a kind and a pair.</li>
<li><b>Four of a Kind</b>: Four cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Straight Flush</b>: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.</li>
<li><b>Royal Flush</b>: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.</li>
</ul><p>The cards are valued in the order:<br>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.</p>
<p>If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.</p>
<p>Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:</p>
<div class="center">

<p>The file, <a href="resources/documents/0054_poker.txt">poker.txt</a>, contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.</p>
<p>How many hands does Player 1 win?</p>

<h1>Problem 55</h1>
<p>If we take $47$, reverse and add, $47 + 74 = 121$, which is palindromic.</p>
<p>Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,</p>
\begin{align}
349 + 943 &amp;= 1292\\
1292 + 2921 &amp;= 4213\\
4213 + 3124 &amp;= 7337
\end{align}
<p>That is, $349$ took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.</p>
<p>Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like $196$, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, $10677$ is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: $4668731596684224866951378664$ ($53$ iterations, $28$-digits).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is $4994$.</p>
<p>How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?</p>
<p class="smaller">NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.</p>

<h1>Problem 56</h1>
<p>A googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only $1$.</p>
<p>Considering natural numbers of the form, $a^b$, where $a, b \lt 100$, what is the maximum digital sum?</p>


<h1>Problem 57</h1>
<p>It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.</p>
<p class="center">$\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$</p>
<p>By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:</p>
<p>$1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac  32 = 1.5$<br>
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$<br>
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \dots$<br>
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29} = 1.41379 \dots$<br></p>
<p>The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac {239}{169}$, and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac {1393}{985}$, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.</p>
<p>In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?</p>


<h1>Problem 58</h1>
<p>Starting with $1$ and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length $7$ is formed.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that $8$ out of the $13$ numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of $8/13 \approx 62\%$.</p>
<p>If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length $9$ will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below $10\%$?</p>


<h1>Problem 59</h1>
<p>Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.</p>
<p>A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.</p>
<p>For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.</p>
<p>Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href="resources/documents/0059_cipher.txt">0059_cipher.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.</p>


<h1>Problem 60</h1>
<p>The primes $3$, $7$, $109$, and $673$, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For example, taking $7$ and $109$, both $7109$ and $1097$ are prime. The sum of these four primes, $792$, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.</p>

<h1>Problem 64</h1>
<p>All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:</p>

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+ \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$

<p>For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$</p>
$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1  {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$

<p>If we continue we would get the following expansion:</p>

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$

<p>The process can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>
$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$<br>
$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$<br>
$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$<br>
$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$<br>
$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$<br>
$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$<br>

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$<br>
$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$<br>
</p>

<p>It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.</p>

<h1>Problem 65</h1>
<p>The square root of $2$ can be written as an infinite continued fraction.</p>
<p>$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}}$</p>
<p>The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that $2$ repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.</p>
<p>It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.</p>
<p>$\begin{align}
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29}
\end{align}$</p>
<p>Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:</p>
<p>$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29}, \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985}, \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$</p>
<p>What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,<br>$e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$.</p>
<p>The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for $e$ are:</p>

<p>The sum of digits in the numerator of the $10$<sup>th</sup> convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.</p>

<h1>Problem 84</h1>
<p>In the game, <strong>Monopoly</strong>, the standard board is set up in the following way:</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0084_monopoly_board.png?1678992052" alt="0084_monopoly_board.png">
</div>
<p>A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.</p>
<p>In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.</p>
<ul><li>Community Chest (2/16 cards):
<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>
<li>Go to JAIL</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Chance (10/16 cards):
<ol><li>Advance to GO</li>
<li>Go to JAIL</li>
<li>Go to C1</li>
<li>Go to E3</li>
<li>Go to H2</li>
<li>Go to R1</li>
<li>Go to next R (railway company)</li>
<li>Go to next R</li>
<li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>
<li>Go back 3 squares.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul><p>The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between "Just Visiting" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to "get out of jail", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.</p>
<p>By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.</p>
<p>Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.</p>
<p>If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.</p>

<h1>Problem 88</h1>
<p>A natural number, $N$, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\}$ is called a product-sum number: $N = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k = a_1 \times a_2 \times \cdots \times a_k$.</p>
<p>For example, $6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 \times 2 \times 3$.</p>
<p>For a given set of size, $k$, we shall call the smallest $N$ with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, $k = 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$ are as follows.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>$k=2$: $4 = 2 \times 2 = 2 + 2$</li>
<li>$k=3$: $6 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 1 + 2 + 3$</li>
<li>$k=4$: $8 = 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4$</li>
<li>$k=5$: $8 = 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2$</li><li>$k=6$: $12 = 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6$</li></ul>

<h1>Problem 90</h1>
<p>Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit ($0$ to $9$) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of $2$-digit numbers.</p>

<p>For example, the square number $64$ could be formed:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0090.png?1678992052" class="dark_img" alt=""><br></div>

<p>In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: $01$, $04$, $09$, $16$, $25$, $36$, $49$, $64$, and $81$.</p>

<p>For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing $\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ on one cube and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9\}$ on the other cube.</p>

<p>However, for this problem we shall allow the $6$ or $9$ to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like $\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\}$ allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain $09$.</p>

<p>In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li>$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ is equivalent to $\{3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5\}$</li>
<li>$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ is distinct from $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9\}$</li></ul>

<p>But because we are allowing $6$ and $9$ to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9\}$ for the purpose of forming $2$-digit numbers.</p>

<p>How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?</p>

<h1>Problem 91</h1>
<p>The points $P(x_1, y_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2)$ are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, $O(0,0)$, to form $\triangle OPQ$.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0091_1.png?1678992052" class="dark_img" alt=""><br></div>

<p>There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between $0$ and $2$ inclusive; that is, $0 \le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \le 2$.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0091_2.png?1678992052" alt=""><br></div>

<p>Given that $0 \le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \le 50$, how many right triangles can be formed?</p>

<h1>Problem 92</h1>
<p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>
<p>For example,
\begin{align}
&amp;44 \to 32 \to 13 \to 10 \to \mathbf 1 \to \mathbf 1\\
&amp;85 \to \mathbf{89} \to 145 \to 42 \to 20 \to 4 \to 16 \to 37 \to 58 \to \mathbf{89}
\end{align}
</p><p>Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.</p>
<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?</p>


<h1>Problem 93</h1>
<p>By using each of the digits from the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations ($+, -, \times, /$) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
\begin{align}
8 &amp;= (4 \times (1 + 3)) / 2\\
14 &amp;= 4 \times (3 + 1 / 2)\\
19 &amp;= 4 \times (2 + 3) - 1\\
36 &amp;= 3 \times 4 \times (2 + 1)
\end{align}
<p>Note that concatenations of the digits, like $12 + 34$, are not allowed.</p>
<p>Using the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which $36$ is the maximum, and each of the numbers $1$ to $28$ can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.</p>
<p>Find the set of four distinct digits, $a \lt b \lt c \lt d$, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, $1$ to $n$, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: <i>abcd</i>.</p>


<h1>Problem 94</h1>
<p>It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the <dfn>almost equilateral triangle</dfn> $5$-$5$-$6$ has an area of $12$ square units.</p>
<p>We shall define an <dfn>almost equilateral triangle</dfn> to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.</p>
<p>Find the sum of the perimeters of all <dfn>almost equilateral triangles</dfn> with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion ($1\,000\,000\,000$).</p>


<h1>Problem 95</h1>
<p>The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of $28$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$. As the sum of these divisors is equal to $28$, we call it a perfect number.</p>
<p>Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $284$ and the sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is $220$, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, $220$ and $284$ are called an amicable pair.</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with $12496$, we form a chain of five numbers:
$$12496 \to 14288 \to 15472 \to 14536 \to 14264 (\to 12496 \to \cdots)$$</p>
<p>Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.</p>
<p>Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.</p>


<h1>Problem 96</h1>
<p>Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p096_1.png" alt="p096_1.png" />     <img src="project/images/p096_2.png" alt="p096_2.png" /></div>
<p>A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered <i>easy</i> because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.</p>
<p>The 6K text file, <a href="project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt">sudoku.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).</p>
<p>By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.</p>

<h1>Problem 97</h1>
<p>The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593} - 1$; it contains exactly $2\,098\,960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form $2^p - 1$, have been found which contain more digits.</p>
<p>However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2\,357\,207$ digits: $28433 \times 2^{7830457} + 1$.</p>
<p>Find the last ten digits of this prime number.</p>


<h1>Problem 98</h1>
<p>By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with $1$, $2$, $9$, and $6$ respectively, we form a square number: $1296 = 36^2$. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: $9216 = 96^2$. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.</p>
<p>Using <a href="resources/documents/0098_words.txt">words.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).</p>

<h1>Problem 99</h1>
<p>Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and $3^7$ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that $2^{11} = 2048 \lt 3^7 = 2187$.</p>

<h1>Problem 100</h1>
<p>If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, $P(\text{BB}) = (15/21) \times (14/20) = 1/2$.</p>
<p>The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly $50\%$ chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.</p>
<p>By finding the first arrangement to contain over $10^{12} = 1\,000\,000\,000\,000$ discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.</p>


<h1>Problem 101</h1>
<p>If we are presented with the first $k$ terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p>
<p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function,<br>$u_n = n^3$: $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \dots$</p>
<p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that "simple is best" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference $7$). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>
<p>We shall define $\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ to be the $n$<sup>th</sup> term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first $k$ terms of a sequence. It should be clear that $\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \le k$, and potentially the <dfn>first incorrect term</dfn> (FIT) will be $\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a <dfn>bad OP</dfn> (BOP).</p>
<p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n \ge 2$, $\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = u_1$.</p>
<p>Hence we obtain the following $\operatorname{OP}$s for the cubic sequence:</p>
<div class="margin_left">
<table><tr><td>$\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = 1$</td>
<td>$1, {\color{red}\mathbf 1}, 1, 1, \dots$</td>
</tr><tr><td>$\operatorname{OP}(2, n) = 7n - 6$</td>
<td>$1, 8, {\color{red}\mathbf{15}}, \dots$</td>
</tr><tr><td>$\operatorname{OP}(3, n) = 6n^2 - 11n + 6$     </td>
<td>$1, 8, 27, {\color{red}\mathbf{58}}, \dots$</td>
</tr><tr><td>$\operatorname{OP}(4, n) = n^3$</td>
<td>$1, 8, 27, 64, 125, \dots$</td>
</tr></table></div>
<p>Clearly no BOPs exist for $k \ge 4$.</p>
<p>By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in <span class="red"><b>red</b></span> above), we obtain $1 + 15 + 58 = 74$.</p>
<p>Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:
$$u_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + n^4 - n^5 + n^6 - n^7 + n^8 - n^9 + n^{10}.$$</p>
<p>Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.</p>

<h1>Problem 103</h1>
<p>Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:</p>

<li>If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) \gt S(C)$.</li>

<li>$n = 4$: $\{3, 5, 6, 7\}$</li>
<li>$n = 5$: $\{6, 9, 11, 12, 13\}$</li></ul>
<p>It <i>seems</i> that for a given optimum set, $A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, the next optimum set is of the form $B = \{b, a_1 + b, a_2 + b, \dots, a_n + b\}$, where $b$ is the "middle" element on the previous row.</p>
<p>By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for $n = 6$ to be $A = \{11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24\}$, with $S(A) = 117$. However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The optimum set for $n = 6$ is $A = \{11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25\}$, with $S(A) = 115$ and corresponding set string: 111819202225.</p>

<h1>Problem 109</h1>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p109.png" class="dark_img" alt="" /><br /></div>
<p>The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.</p>
<p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>
<p>There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a "doubles out" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is "bust".</p>
<p>When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a "checkout" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).</p>
<p>There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:</p>

<p>So $M(4, 1) = 3$ is the maximum number of repeated digits for a $4$-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are $N(4, 1) = 9$ such primes, and the sum of these primes is $S(4, 1) = 22275$. It turns out that for $d = 0$, it is only possible to have $M(4, 0) = 2$ repeated digits, but there are $N(4, 0) = 13$ such cases.</p>
<p>In the same way we obtain the following results for $4$-digit primes.</p>

<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, $134468$.</p>
<p>Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, $66420$.</p>
<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, $155349$.</p>
<p>Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand ($525$) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches $50\%$ is $538$.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach $21780$ the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to $90\%$.</p>

<h1>Problem 114</h1>
<p>A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one grey square. There are exactly seventeen ways of doing this.</p>

<p>Let the fill-count function, $F(m, n)$, represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.</p>
<p>For example, $F(3, 29) = 673135$ and $F(3, 30) = 1089155$.</p>
<p>That is, for $m = 3$, it can be seen that $n = 30$ is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.</p>
<p>In the same way, for $m = 10$, it can be verified that $F(10, 56) = 880711$ and $F(10, 57) = 1148904$, so $n = 57$ is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.</p>

<h1>Problem 119</h1>
<p>The number $512$ is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: $5 + 1 + 2 = 8$, and $8^3 = 512$. Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$.</p>
<p>We shall define $a_n$ to be the $n$th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.</p>

<p>For example, if $a = 7$ and $n = 3$, then $r = 42$: $6^3 + 8^3 = 728 \equiv 42 \mod 49$. And as $n$ varies, so too will $r$, but for $a = 7$ it turns out that $r_{\mathrm{max}} = 42$.</p>
<p>For $3 \le a \le 1000$, find $\sum r_{\mathrm{max}}$.</p>


<h1>Problem 121</h1>
<p>A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc. In a game of chance a player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted. After each turn the disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another disc is taken at random.</p>
<p>The player pays £1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs than red discs at the end of the game.</p>
<p>If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player winning is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker should allocate for winning in this game would be £10 before they would expect to incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number of pounds and also includes the original £1 paid to play the game, so in the example given the player actually wins £9.</p>
<p>Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game in which fifteen turns are played.</p>


<h1>Problem 122</h1>
<p>The most naive way of computing $n^{15}$ requires fourteen multiplications:
$$n \times n \times \cdots \times n = n^{15}.$$</p>
<p>But using a "binary" method you can compute it in six multiplications:</p>
\begin{align}
n \times n &amp;= n^2\\
n^2 \times n^2 &amp;= n^4\\
n^4 \times n^4 &amp;= n^8\\
n^8 \times n^4 &amp;= n^{12}\\
n^{12} \times n^2 &amp;= n^{14}\\
n^{14} \times n &amp;= n^{15}
\end{align}
<p>However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:</p>
\begin{align}
n \times n &amp;= n^2\\
n^2 \times n &amp;= n^3\\
n^3 \times n^3 &amp;= n^6\\
n^6 \times n^6 &amp;= n^{12}\\
n^{12} \times n^3 &amp;= n^{15}
\end{align}
<p>We shall define $m(k)$ to be the minimum number of multiplications to compute $n^k$; for example $m(15) = 5$.</p>
<p>Find $\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{200} m(k)$.</p>

<p>Let $p_n$ be the $n$th prime: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots$, and let $r$ be the remainder when $(p_n - 1)^n + (p_n + 1)^n$ is divided by $p_n^2$.</p>
<p>For example, when $n = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, and $4^3 + 6^3 = 280 \equiv 5 \mod 25$.</p>
<p>The least value of $n$ for which the remainder first exceeds $10^9$ is $7037$.</p>

<h1>Problem 124</h1>
<p>The radical of $n$, $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. For example, $504 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 7$, so $\operatorname{rad}(504) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42$.</p>
<p>If we calculate $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 10$, then sort them on $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, and sorting on $n$ if the radical values are equal, we get:</p>

<h1>Problem 125</h1>

<p>There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is $4164$. Note that $1 = 0^2 + 1^2$ has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the numbers less than $10^8$ that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.</p>


<h1>Problem 126</h1>
<p>The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring $3 \times 2 \times 1$ is twenty-two.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0126.png?1678992052" class="dark_img" alt=""><br></div>
<p>If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.</p>
<p>However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring $5 \times 1 \times 1$ also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring $5 \times 3 \times 1$, $7 \times 2 \times 1$, and $11 \times 1 \times 1$ all contain forty-six cubes.</p>
<p>We shall define $C(n)$ to represent the number of cuboids that contain $n$ cubes in one of its layers. So $C(22) = 2$, $C(46) = 4$, $C(78) = 5$, and $C(118) = 8$.</p>
<p>It turns out that $154$ is the least value of $n$ for which $C(n) = 10$.</p>

<h1>Problem 127</h1>
<p>The radical of $n$, $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of distinct prime factors of $n$. For example, $504 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 7$, so $\operatorname{rad}(504) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42$.</p>
<p>We shall define the triplet of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ to be an abc-hit if:</p>
<ol><li>$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a, c) = \gcd(b, c) = 1$</li>
<li>$a \lt b$</li>
<li>$a + b = c$</li>
<li>$\operatorname{rad}(abc) \lt c$</li>

<p>By finding the difference between tile $n$ and each of its six neighbours we shall define $\operatorname{PD}(n)$ to be the number of those differences which are prime.</p>
<p>For example, working clockwise around tile $8$ the differences are $12, 29, 11, 6, 1$, and $13$. So $\operatorname{PD}(8) = 3$.</p>
<p>In the same way, the differences around tile $17$ are $1, 17, 16, 1, 11$, and $10$, hence $\operatorname{PD}(17) = 2$.</p>

<p>A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) = 111111$.</p>
<p>Given that $n$ is a positive integer and $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$, it can be shown that there always exists a value, $k$, for which $R(k)$ is divisible by $n$, and let $A(n)$ be the least such value of $k$; for example, $A(7) = 6$ and $A(41) = 5$.</p>
<p>You are given that for all primes, $p \gt 5$, that $p - 1$ is divisible by $A(p)$. For example, when $p = 41$, $A(41) = 5$, and $40$ is divisible by $5$.</p>

<p>How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?</p>


<h1>Problem 132</h1>
<p>A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$.</p>
<p>For example, $R(10) = 1111111111 = 11 \times 41 \times 271 \times 9091$, and the sum of these prime factors is $9414$.</p>

<p>A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) = 111111$.</p>
<p>Let us consider repunits of the form $R(10^n)$.</p>
<p>Although $R(10)$, $R(100)$, or $R(1000)$ are not divisible by $17$, $R(10000)$ is divisible by $17$. Yet there is no value of $n$ for which $R(10^n)$ will divide by $19$. In fact, it is remarkable that $11$, $17$, $41$, and $73$ are the only four primes below one-hundred that can  be a factor of $R(10^n)$.</p>

<p>In fact, with the exception of $p_1 = 3$ and $p_2 = 5$, for every pair of consecutive primes, $p_2 \gt p_1$, there exist values of $n$ for which the last digits are formed by $p_1$ and $n$ is divisible by $p_2$. Let $S$ be the smallest of these values of $n$.</p>

$$34^2 - 27^2 - 20^2 = 12^2 - 9^2 - 6^2 = 27.$$</p>
<p>It turns out that $n = 1155$ is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.</p>
<p>How many values of $n$ less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?</p>


<h1>Problem 136</h1>

<img src="resources/images/0138.png?1678992052" width="230" height="228" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, $h = \sqrt{17^2 - 8^2} = 15$, which is one less than the base length.</p>
<p>With $b = 272$ and $L = 305$, we get $h = 273$, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that $h = b \pm 1$.</p>
<p>Find $\sum L$ for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which $h = b \pm 1$ and $b$, $L$ are positive integers.</p>


<h1>Problem 139</h1>
<p>Let $(a, b, c)$ represent the three sides of a right angle triangle with integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles together to form a square with length $c$.</p>
<p>For example, $(3, 4, 5)$ triangles can be placed together to form a $5$ by $5$ square with a $1$ by $1$ hole in the middle and it can be seen that the $5$ by $5$ square can be tiled with twenty-five $1$ by $1$ squares.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0139.png?1678992052" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>However, if $(5, 12, 13)$ triangles were used then the hole would measure $7$ by $7$ and these could not be used to tile the $13$ by $13$ square.</p>
<p>Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take place?</p>


<h1>Problem 140</h1>
<p>Consider the infinite polynomial series $A_G(x) = x G_1 + x^2 G_2 + x^3 G_3 + \cdots$, where $G_k$ is the $k$th term of the second order recurrence relation $G_k = G_{k-1} + G_{k-2}$, $G_1 = 1$ and $G_2 = 4$; that is, $1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, \dots$.</p>
<p>For this problem we shall be concerned with values of $x$ for which $A_G(x)$ is a positive integer.</p>

<h1>Problem 141</h1>
<p>A positive integer, $n$, is divided by $d$ and the quotient and remainder are $q$ and $r$ respectively. In addition $d$, $q$, and $r$ are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p>For example, $58$ divided by $6$ has quotient $9$ and remainder $4$. It can also be seen that $4, 6, 9$ are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio $3/2$).<br>
We will call such numbers, $n$, progressive.</p>
<p>Some progressive numbers, such as $9$ and $10404 = 102^2$, happen to also be perfect squares.<br> The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is $124657$.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion ($10^{12}$).</p>


<h1>Problem 142</h1>
<p>Find the smallest $x + y + z$ with integers $x \gt y \gt z \gt 0$ such that $x + y$, $x - y$, $x + z$, $x - z$, $y + z$, $y - z$ are all perfect squares.</p>

<h1>Problem 143</h1>
<p>Let $ABC$ be a triangle with all interior angles being less than $120$ degrees. Let $X$ be any point inside the triangle and let $XA = p$, $XC = q$, and $XB = r$.</p>
<p>Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of $X$ such that $p + q + r$ was minimised.</p>
<p>Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles $AOB$, $BNC$ and $AMC$ are constructed on each side of triangle $ABC$, the circumscribed circles of $AOB$, $BNC$, and $AMC$ will intersect at a single point, $T$, inside the triangle. Moreover he proved that $T$, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises $p + q + r$. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that when the sum is minimised, $AN = BM = CO = p + q + r$ and that $AN$, $BM$ and $CO$ also intersect at $T$.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="resources/images/0143_torricelli.png?1678992052" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>If the sum is minimised and $a, b, c, p, q$ and $r$ are all positive integers we shall call triangle $ABC$ a Torricelli triangle. For example, $a = 399$, $b = 455$, $c = 511$ is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with $p + q + r = 784$.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all distinct values of $p + q + r \le 120000$ for Torricelli triangles.</p>


<h1>Problem 144</h1>
<p>In laser physics, a "white cell" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.</p>
<p>The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation $4x^2 + y^2 = 100$.</p>
<p>The section corresponding to $-0.01 \le x \le +0.01$ at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="resources/images/0144_1.png?1678992052" class="dark_img" style="margin:10px 20px;" alt=""><img src="resources/images/0144_2.gif?1678992055" class="dark_img" style="margin:10px 20px;" alt=""></div>
<p>The light beam in this problem starts at the point $(0.0,10.1)$ just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at $(1.4,-9.6)$.</p>
<p>Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection "angle of incidence equals angle of reflection." That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.</p>
<p>In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.</p>
<p>The slope $m$ of the tangent line at any point $(x,y)$ of the given ellipse is: $m = -4x/y$.</p><p>The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.</p>
<p>The animation on the right shows the first $10$ reflections of the beam.</p>

<p>How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell before exiting?</p>

<h1>Problem 145</h1>
<p>Some positive integers $n$ have the property that the sum $[n + \operatorname{reverse}(n)]$ consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, $36 + 63 = 99$ and $409 + 904 = 1313$. We will call such numbers <dfn>reversible</dfn>; so $36$, $63$, $409$, and $904$ are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either $n$ or $\operatorname{reverse}(n)$.</p>

<p>There are $120$ reversible numbers below one-thousand.</p>

<p>There are $5$ grids smaller than $3 \times 2$, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. $1 \times 1$, $2 \times 1$, $3 \times 1$, $1 \times 2$ and $2 \times 2$. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:</p>

<h1>Problem 149</h1>
<p>Looking at the table below, it is easy to verify that the maximum possible sum of adjacent numbers in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal) <span style="white-space:nowrap;">is $16$ ($= 8 + 7 + 1$).</span></p>

<div class="center">

<p>Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:</p>

<p>First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form of what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":</p>

<p>For $1 \le k \le 55$, $s_k = [100003 - 200003 k + 300007 k^3] \pmod{1000000} - 500000$.<br>
For $56 \le k \le 4000000$, $s_k = [s_{k-24} + s_{k - 55} + 1000000] \pmod{1000000} - 500000$.</p>

<p>Thus, $s_{10} = -393027$ and $s_{100} = 86613$.</p>

<p>The terms of $s$ are then arranged in a $2000 \times 2000$ table, using the first $2000$ numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next $2000$ numbers to fill the second row, and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).</p>

<h1>Problem 150</h1>
<p>In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest possible.</p>
<p>In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0150.gif?1678992055" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>k</sub></span> in the range ±2<sup>19</sup>, using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:</p>
<p class="margin_left"><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> := 0

    <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> := (615949*<span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> + 797807) modulo 2<sup>20</sup><br>
    <span style="font-style:italic;">s<sub>k</sub></span> := <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>−2<sup>19</sup></p>

The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements it contains.

<p>Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.</p>

<p>The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the first batch of the week.</p>

<h1>Problem 152</h1>
<p>There are several ways to write the number $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as a sum of square reciprocals using <i>distinct</i> integers.</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}\dfrac{1}{2} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{2^2} + \dfrac{1}{3^2} + \dfrac{1}{4^2} + \dfrac{1}{5^2} +\\

<p>How many ways are there to write $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as a sum of reciprocals of squares using distinct integers between $2$ and $80$ inclusive?</p>

<h1>Problem 153</h1>
<p>As we all know the equation $x^2=-1$ has no solutions for real $x$.
<br>
If we however introduce the imaginary number $i$ this equation has two solutions: $x=i$ and $x=-i$.
<br>
If we go a step further the equation $(x-3)^2=-4$ has two complex solutions: $x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$.
<br>$x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$ are called each others' complex conjugate.
<br>
Numbers of the form $a+bi$ are called complex numbers.
<br>
In general $a+bi$ and $a-bi$ are each other's complex conjugate.</p>
<p>A Gaussian Integer is a complex number $a+bi$ such that both $a$ and $b$ are integers.
<br>
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with $b=0$).
<br>
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with $b \ne 0$ we call such integers "rational integers."
<br>
A Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is called a divisor of a rational integer $n$ if the result $\dfrac n {a + bi}$ is also a Gaussian integer.
<br>
If for example we divide $5$ by $1+2i$ we can simplify $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:
<br>
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of $1+2i$: $1-2i$.
<br>
The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
<br>
So $1+2i$ is a divisor of $5$.
<br>
Note that $1+i$ is not a divisor of $5$ because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.
<br>
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer $(a+bi)$ is a divisor of a rational integer $n$, then its complex conjugate $(a-bi)$ is also a divisor of $n$.</p>
<p>In fact, $5$ has six divisors such that the real part is positive: $\{1, 1 + 2i, 1 - 2i, 2 + i, 2 - i, 5\}$.
<br>
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:</p>
<table align="center" border="1"><tr><td width="20">
$n$</td><td> Gaussian integer divisors<br>
with positive real part</td><td>Sum $s(n)$ of <br>these

</tr><tr><td>$5$</td><td>$1, 1+2i, 1-2i, 2+i, 2-i, 5$</td><td>$12$</td>
</tr></table><p>For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{5} {s(n)} = 35$.</p>
<p>$\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{10^5} {s(n)} = 17924657155$.</p>

<h1>Problem 155</h1>
<p>An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value $C$.
<br>
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.</p>
<p>Using this simple procedure and up to $n$ identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to $n=3$ capacitors of $\pu{60 \mu F}$ each, we can obtain the following $7$ distinct total capacitance values: </p>
<div class="center"><img src="resources/images/0155_capacitors1.gif?1678992055" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>If we denote by $D(n)$ the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to $n$ equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: $D(1)=1$, $D(2)=3$, $D(3)=7$, $\dots$</p>
<p>Find $D(18)$.</p>
<p><i>Reminder:</i> When connecting capacitors $C_1, C_2$ etc in parallel, the total capacitance is $C_T = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots$,

whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by: $\dfrac{1}{C_T} = \dfrac{1}{C_1} + \dfrac{1}{C_2} + \cdots$</p>

$0\,1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,7\,8\,9\,10\,11\,12\cdots$
</p>
<p>Consider the digit $d=1$. After we write down each number $n$, we will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number $f(n,1)$. The first values for $f(n,1)$, then, are as follows:</p>
\begin{array}{cc}
n &amp; f(n, 1)\\
\hline
0 &amp; 0\\

10 &amp; 2\\
11 &amp; 4\\
12 &amp; 5
\end{array}

<p>Note that $f(n,1)$ never equals $3$.
<br>
So the first two solutions of the equation $f(n,1)=n$ are $n=0$ and $n=1$. The next solution is $n=199981$.</p>
<p>In the same manner the function $f(n,d)$ gives the total number of digits $d$ that have been written down after the number $n$ has been written.
<br>
In fact, for every digit $d \ne 0$, $0$ is the first solution of the equation $f(n,d)=n$.</p>
<p>Let $s(d)$ be the sum of all the solutions for which $f(n,d)=n$.
<br>
You are given that $s(1)=22786974071$.</p>
<p>Find  $\sum s(d)$ for $1 \le d \le 9$.</p>
<p>Note: if, for some $n$, $f(n,d)=n$ for more than one value of $d$ this value of $n$ is counted again for every value of $d$ for which $f(n,d)=n$.</p>

<p>Recall that the digital root of a number, in base $10$, is found by adding together the digits of that number, 
and repeating that process until a number is arrived at that is less than $10$.  
Thus the digital root of $467$ is $8$.</p>

<h1>Problem 165</h1>
<p>A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.<br> By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities:<br> 
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.</p>
<p>Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.<br>
We will call a common point $T$ of two segments $L_1$ and $L_2$ a true intersection point of $L_1$ and $L_2$ if $T$ is the only common point of $L_1$ and $L_2$ and $T$ is an interior point of both segments.
</p>
<p>Consider the three segments $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>$L_1$: $(27, 44)$ to $(12, 32)$</li>
<li>$L_2$: $(46, 53)$ to $(17, 62)$</li>
<li>$L_3$: $(46, 70)$ to $(22, 40)$</li></ul>
<p>It can be verified that line segments $L_2$ and $L_3$ have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of $L_3$: $(22,40)$ lies on $L_1$ this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. $L_1$ and $L_2$ have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.</p>
<p>Now let us do the same for $5000$ line segments. To this end, we generate $20000$ numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator.</p>
\begin{align}
s_0 &amp;= 290797\\
s_{n + 1} &amp;= s_n \times s_n \pmod{50515093}\\
t_n &amp;= s_n \pmod{500}
\end{align}
<p>To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers $t_n$. That is, the first line segment is given by:</p>
<p>$(t_1, t_2)$ to $(t_3, t_4)$.</p>
<p>The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: $27$, $144$, $12$ and $232$. The first segment would thus be $(27,144)$ to $(12,232)$.</p>

<p>Choose $p = 1009$ and $q = 3643$.<br>
Find the sum of all values of $e$, $1 \lt e \lt \phi(1009,3643)$ and $\gcd(e, \phi) = 1$, so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of $e$ is at a minimum.</p>

<h1>Problem 183</h1>
<p>Let $N$ be a positive integer and let $N$ be split into $k$ equal parts, $r = N/k$, so that $N = r + r + \cdots + r$.<br>
Let $P$ be the product of these parts, $P = r \times r \times \cdots \times r = r^k$.</p>

<p>For example, if $11$ is split into five equal parts, $11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2$, then $P = 2.2^5 = 51.53632$.</p>

<p>Let $M(N) = P_{\mathrm{max}}$ for a given value of $N$.</p>

<p>It turns out that the maximum for $N = 11$ is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to $P_{\mathrm{max}} = (11/4)^4$; that is, $M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625$, which is a terminating decimal.</p>

<p>However, for $N = 8$ the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so $M(8) = 512/27$, which is a non-terminating decimal.</p>

<p>Let $D(N) = N$ if $M(N)$ is a non-terminating decimal and $D(N) = -N$ if $M(N)$ is a terminating decimal.</p>

<p>For example, $\sum\limits_{N = 5}^{100} D(N)$ is $2438$.</p>

<p>Find $\sum\limits_{N = 5}^{10000} D(N)$.</p>

<p>For an integer $n \ge 4$, we define the <dfn>lower prime square root</dfn> of $n$, denoted by $\operatorname{lps}(n)$, as the largest prime $\le \sqrt n$ and the <dfn>upper prime square root</dfn> of $n$, $\operatorname{ups}(n)$, as the smallest prime $\ge \sqrt n$.</p>
<p>So, for example, $\operatorname{lps}(4) = 2 = \operatorname{ups}(4)$, $\operatorname{lps}(1000) = 31$, $\operatorname{ups}(1000) = 37$.<br>
Let us call an integer $n \ge 4$ <dfn>semidivisible</dfn>, if one of $\operatorname{lps}(n)$ and $\operatorname{ups}(n)$ divides $n$, but not both.</p>

<p>The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding $15$ is $30$, the numbers are $8$, $10$ and $12$.<br> $15$ is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both $\operatorname{lps}(15) = 3$ and $\operatorname{ups}(15) = 5$.<br>
As a further example, the sum of the $92$ semidivisible numbers up to $1000$ is $34825$.</p>

<h1>Problem 236</h1>
<p>Suppliers 'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market:</p>

<p>Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - <i>i.e.</i> products gone bad.</p>

<p>The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:</p><ul><li>The five <i>per-product spoilage rates</i> for each supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied, for each of the five products in turn.</li>
  <li>The <i>overall spoilage rate</i> for each supplier is equal to the total number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by that supplier.</li></ul><p>To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates), <var>m</var>&gt;1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of <var>m</var>.</p>

<h1>Problem 238</h1>
<p>Create a sequence of numbers using the "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number generator:</p>

\begin{align}
s_0 &amp;= 14025256\\
s_{n + 1} &amp;= s_n^2 \bmod 20300713
\end{align}

<p>Concatenate these numbers $s_0s_1s_2\cdots$ to create a string $w$ of infinite length.<br>
Then, $w = {\color{blue}14025256741014958470038053646\cdots}$</p>

<p>For a positive integer $k$, if no substring of $w$ exists with a sum of digits equal to $k$, $p(k)$ is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of $w$ exists with a sum of digits equal to $k$, we define $p(k) = z$, where $z$ is the starting position of the earliest such substring.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>The substrings $\color{blue}1, 14, 1402, \dots$<br>
with respective sums of digits equal to $1, 5, 7, \dots$<br>
start at position $\mathbf 1$, hence $p(1) = p(5) = p(7) = \cdots = \mathbf 1$.</p>

<p>The substrings $\color{blue}4, 402, 4025, \dots$<br>
with respective sums of digits equal to $4, 6, 11, \dots$<br>
start at position $\mathbf 2$, hence $p(4) = p(6) = p(11) = \cdots = \mathbf 2$.</p>

<p>The substrings $\color{blue}02, 0252, \dots$<br>
with respective sums of digits equal to $2, 9, \dots$<br>
start at position $\mathbf 3$, hence $p(2) = p(9) = \cdots = \mathbf 3$.</p>

<p>Note that substring $\color{blue}025$ starting at position $\mathbf 3$, has a sum of digits equal to $7$, but there was an earlier substring (starting at position $\mathbf 1$) with a sum of digits equal to $7$, so $p(7) = 1$, <i>not</i> $3$.</p>

<p>We can verify that, for $0 \lt k \le 10^3$, $\sum p(k) = 4742$.</p>

<p>Find $\sum p(k)$, for $0 \lt k \le 2 \times 10^{15}$.</p>

<h1>Problem 253</h1>
<p>A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers $1$ to $40$ in order.</p>

<p>Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.<br> As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together.<br> The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).</p><p>

</p><p>For example:</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="grid" style="margin:0 auto;"><tr><th width="80" align="center"><b>Piece Placed</b></th>
<th width="80" align="center"><b>Segments So Far</b></th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td align="center">29</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">34</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">35</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">…</td><td align="center">…</td></tr></table></div>

<p>Let $M$ be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.<br>
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each $M$ is</p>
<div class="center">
<table class="grid" style="margin:0 auto;"><tr><th width="50" align="center"><b><var>M</var></b></th>
<th width="90" align="center"><b>Possibilities</b></th></tr>

<p>Define $sg(i)$ as the sum of the digits of $g(i)$. So $sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7$.</p>

<p>Further, it can be verified that $g(20)$ is $267$ and $\sum sg(i)$ for $1 \le i \le 20$ is $156$.</p>

<p>What is $\sum sg(i)$ for $1 \le i \le 150$?</p>

<h1>Problem 255</h1>
<p>We define the <dfn>rounded-square-root</dfn> of a positive integer $n$ as the square root of $n$ rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of $n$:</p>
<p>Let $d$ be the number of digits of the number $n$.<br>
If $d$ is odd, set $x_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.<br>
If $d$ is even, set $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.<br>
Repeat:</p>
$$x_{k+1} = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{x_k + \lceil{n / x_k}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor$$

<p>until $x_{k+1} = x_k$.</p>
<p>As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of $n = 4321$.<br>$n$ has $4$ digits, so $x_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.<br>
$$x_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 / 70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$
$$x_2 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 / 66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$

Since $x_2 = x_1$, we stop here.<br>
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of $4321$ is $66$ (the actual square root is $65.7343137\cdots$).
</p>
<p>The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.<br>
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a $5$-digit integer ($10\,000 \le n \le 99\,999$) with an average of $3.2102888889$ iterations (the average value was rounded to $10$ decimal places).
</p>
<p>Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a $14$-digit number ($10^{13} \le n \lt 10^{14}$)?<br>
Give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.

<h1>Problem 256</h1>
<p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>

<p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions $1 \times 2$, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>

<p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions $a, b$ and even size $s = a \cdot b$.<br>
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition $a \le b$.</p>

<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br>
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a $4 \times 4$ room:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="resources/images/0256_tatami3.gif?1678992056" alt="0256_tatami3.gif"><br></div>

<p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red "<span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>X</b></span>" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>

<p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.<br>
Further, we define $T(s)$ as the number of tatami-free rooms of size $s$.</p>

<p>The smallest tatami-free room has size $s = 70$ and dimensions $7 \times 10$.<br>
All the other rooms of size $s = 70$ can be covered with tatami; they are: $1 \times 70$, $2 \times 35$ and $5 \times 14$.<br>
Hence, $T(70) = 1$.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can verify that $T(1320) = 5$ because there are exactly $5$ tatami-free rooms of size $s = 1320$:<br>
$20 \times 66$, $22 \times 60$, $24 \times 55$, $30 \times 44$ and $33 \times 40$.<br>
In fact, $s = 1320$ is the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) = 5$.</p>

<h1>Problem 284</h1>
<p>The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same digits: 376<sup>2</sup> = 141376. Let's call a number with this property a steady square.</p>

<p>Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady square: c37<sup>2</sup> = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the same numbering system. The letters a, b, c and d are used for the 10, 11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the hexadecimal numbering system.</p>

<p>For 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, the sum of the digits of all the n-digit steady squares in the base 14 numbering system is 2d8 (582 decimal). Steady squares with leading 0's are not allowed.</p>

<h1>Problem 285</h1>
<p>Albert chooses a positive integer $k$, then two real numbers $a, b$ are randomly chosen in the interval $[0,1]$ with uniform distribution.<br>
The square root of the sum $(k \cdot a + 1)^2 + (k \cdot b + 1)^2$ is then computed and rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to $k$, he scores $k$ points; otherwise he scores nothing.</p>

<p>For example, if $k = 6$, $a = 0.2$ and $b = 0.85$, then $(k \cdot a + 1)^2 + (k \cdot b + 1)^2 = 42.05$.<br>
The square root of $42.05$ is $6.484\cdots$ and when rounded to the nearest integer, it becomes $6$.<br>
This is equal to $k$, so he scores $6$ points.</p>

<p>It can be shown that if he plays $10$ turns with $k = 1, k = 2, \dots, k = 10$, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places, is $10.20914$.</p>

<h1>Problem 300</h1>
<p>In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. <br>
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are $2^n$ distinct proteins consisting of $n$ elements.</p>

<p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.<br>
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.<br>
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in <u>two dimensions</u>.</p>

<p>The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).</p>

<div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0300_protein.gif?1678992056" alt="0300_protein.gif"></div>

<p>The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.<br>
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.</p>

<p>Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length $8$ turns out to be $850 / 2^8 = 3.3203125$.</p>

<ul><li>zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or</li>
<li>non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.</li>
</ul><p>For example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses.

<ul><li>$n = 1$: No valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.</li>
<li>$n = 2$: Only one valid move, after which the second player loses.</li>
<li>$n = 3$: Two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.</li>
<li>$n = 4$: Three valid moves for the first player, who is able to win the game by painting the two middle squares.</li>
<li>$n = 5$: Four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red), but no matter what the player does, the second player (blue) wins.</li>
</ul><div class="center"><img src="project/images/p306_pstrip.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p306_pstrip.gif" /></div>

<p>So, for $1 \le n \le 5$, there are 3 values of $n$ for which the first player can force a win.<br />
Similarly, for $1 \le n \le 50$, there are 40 values of $n$ for which the first player can force a win.</p>

<p>For $1 \le n \le 1 000 000$, how many values of $n$ are there for which the first player can force a win?</p>

<h1>Problem 308</h1>
<p>A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.</p>

<p>The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.</p>

<p>For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:</p>

<p>$$\dfrac{17}{91}, \dfrac{78}{85}, \dfrac{19}{51}, \dfrac{23}{38}, \dfrac{29}{33}, \dfrac{77}{29}, \dfrac{95}{23}, \dfrac{77}{19}, \dfrac{1}{17}, \dfrac{11}{13}, \dfrac{13}{11}, \dfrac{15}{2}, \dfrac{1}{7}, \dfrac{55}{1}$$</p>

<p>Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce the sequence:<br />
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, <b>4</b>, 30, ..., 136, <b>8</b>, 60, ..., 544, <b>32</b>, 240, ...</p>

<p>The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup>, ...<br />
It can be shown that <i>all</i> the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime exponents and that <i>all</i> the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in proper order!</p>

<p>If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7 (find the 10001<sup>st</sup> prime), how many iterations would be needed until the program produces 2<sup>10001st prime</sup> ?</p>

<h1>Problem 314</h1>
<p>
The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but there is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a $\pu{500 m}$ by $\pu{500 m}$ square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall in. $251001$ posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with $1$ meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.
</p>
<p>
The bigger countries of course have built a $\pu{2000 m}$ wall enclosing the entire $\pu{250 000 m^2}$ area. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick">Duchy of Grand Fenwick</a>, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.
</p>
<p>
You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.
For a $2000$ meter wall enclosing the $\pu{250 000 m^2}$ area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is $125$.<br>
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to $\pi \times \pu{250^2 m^2}$ and the perimeter will be $\pi \times \pu{500 m}$, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be $125$.
</p>
<p>
However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides $\pu{75 m}$, $\pu{75 m}$ and $75\pu{\sqrt 2 m}$ the total area becomes $\pu{238750 m^2}$ and the perimeter becomes $1400+300\pu{\sqrt 2 m}$. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of $130.87$, which is significantly better.

<h1>Problem 315</h1>
<p></p><div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0315_clocks.gif?1678992056" alt="0315_clocks.gif"></div>

<p>Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two "digital root" clocks.<br>
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.</p>

<p>When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.<br>
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: "<b>137</b>" → "<b>11</b>" → "<b>2</b>" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.</p>

<p>Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).<br>
Number "<b>1</b>" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number "<b>4</b>" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number "<b>8</b>" lights them all.</p>

<p>The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.<br>
To turn on a "<b>2</b>" will cost 5 transitions, while a "<b>7</b>" will cost only 4 transitions.</p>

<p>Sam and Max built two different clocks.</p>

<p>Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows "<b>137</b>", then the panel is turned off, then the next number ("<b>11</b>") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number ("<b>2</b>") is turned on and, after some time, off.<br>
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:<br></p><table><tr><td>"<b>137</b>"</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>(2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions ("<b>137</b>" on/off).</td>
</tr><tr><td>"<b>11</b>"</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>(2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions ("<b>11</b>" on/off).</td>
</tr><tr><td>"<b>2</b>"</td>
<td>:</td>
<td>(5) × 2 = 10 transitions ("<b>2</b>" on/off).</td>
</tr></table>
For a grand total of 40 transitions.

<p>Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.<br>
For number 137, Max's clock requires:<br></p><table><tr><td>"<b>137</b>"<br><br></td>
<td>:<br><br></td>
<td>2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions ("<b>137</b>" on)<br>
7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number "<b>11</b>").</td>
</tr><tr><td>"<b>11</b>"<br><br><br></td>
<td>:<br><br><br></td>
<td>0 transitions (number "<b>11</b>" is already turned on correctly)<br>
3 transitions (to turn off the first "<b>1</b>" and the bottom part of the second "<b>1</b>"; <br>
the top part is common with number "<b>2</b>").</td>
</tr><tr><td>"<b>2</b>"<br><br></td>
<td>:<br><br></td>
<td>4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a "<b>2</b>")<br>
5 transitions (to turn off number "<b>2</b>").</td>
</tr></table>
For a grand total of 30 transitions.

<p>Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.<br>
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10<sup>7</sup> and B = 2×10<sup>7</sup>. <br>
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.</p>

<p>Let $p = p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots$ be an infinite sequence of random digits, selected from $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with equal probability.<br>
It can be seen that $p$ corresponds to the real number $0.p_1 p_2 p_3 \cdots$ <br>
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval $[0,1)$ is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits selected from $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with equal probability.</p>

Also, let $g(n)$ be the expected value of $k$; it can be proven that $g(n)$ is always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.</p>

<p>For example, if $n = 535$, then<br>
for $p = 31415926\mathbf{535}897\cdots$, we get $k = 9$<br>
for $p = 35528714365004956000049084876408468\mathbf{535}4\cdots$, we get $k = 36$<br>
etc and we find that $g(535) = 1008$.</p>

<h1>Problem 327</h1>
<p>A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0327_rooms_of_doom.gif?1678992056" alt="0327_rooms_of_doom.gif"></div>

<p>Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.</p>

<p>If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!</p>

<p>However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.</p>

<p>It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of $123$ security cards while carrying a maximum of $3$ cards.</p>

<p>Let $C$ be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.</p>
<p>Let $R$ be the number of rooms to travel through.</p>
<p>Let $M(C,R)$ be the minimum number of cards required from the dispensing machine to travel through $R$ rooms carrying up to a maximum of $C$ cards at any time.</p>

<p>For example, $M(3,6)=123$ and $M(4,6)=23$.<br>And, $\sum M(C, 6) = 146$ for $3 \le C \le 4$.</p>


<p>You are given that $\sum M(C,10)=10382$ for $3 \le C \le 10$.</p>

<p>Find $\sum M(C,30)$ for $3 \le C \le 40$.</p>



<h1>Problem 328</h1>
<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, has a <u>cost equal to the number asked</u> and we get one of three possible answers:<br></p><ul><li> "Your guess is lower than the hidden number", or</li>
<li> "Yes, that's it!", or</li>
<li> "Your guess is higher than the hidden number".</li>
</ul><p>Given the value of $n$, an <dfn>optimal strategy</dfn> minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) <u>for the worst possible case</u>. E.g.</p>

<p>If $n=3$, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number "<b>2</b>". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost $= 2$).</p>

<p>If $n=8$, we might decide to use a "binary search" type of strategy: Our first question would be "$\mathbf 4$" and if the hidden number is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.<br>
Let our second question be "$\mathbf 6$". If the hidden number is still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between $7$ and $8$.<br>
Thus, our third question will be "$\mathbf 7$" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be $4+6+7={\color{red}\mathbf{17}}$.</p>

<p>We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for $n=8$, by asking "$\mathbf 5$" as our first question.<br>
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than $5$, our second question will be "$\mathbf 7$", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of $5+7={\color{blue}\mathbf{12}}$).<br>
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than $5$, our second question will be "$\mathbf 3$" and if the hidden number is lower than $3$ our third question will be "$\mathbf 1$", giving a total cost of $5+3+1={\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$.<br>
Since ${\color{blue}\mathbf{12}} \gt {\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$, the worst-case cost for this strategy is ${\color{red}\mathbf{12}}$. That's better than what we achieved previously with the "binary search" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.<br>
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for $n=8$.</p>

<p>Let $C(n)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for $n$, as described above.<br>
Thus $C(1) = 0$, $C(2) = 1$, $C(3) = 2$ and $C(8) = 12$.<br>
Similarly, $C(100) = 400$ and $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{100} C(n) = 17575$.</p>

<p>Find $\sum \limits_{n = 1}^{200000} C(n)$.</p>

<h1>Problem 330</h1>
An infinite sequence of real numbers $a(n)$ is defined for all integers $n$ as follows:
$$a(n) = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; n \lt 0\\
\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{\infty}{\dfrac{a(n - i)}{i!}} &amp; n \ge 0
\end{cases}$$

<p>For example,<br></p>

<p>$a(0) = \dfrac{1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots = e - 1$<br>
$a(1) = \dfrac{e - 1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots = 2e - 3$<br>
$a(2) = \dfrac{2e - 3}{1!} + \dfrac{e - 1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots = \dfrac{7}{2}e - 6$</p>

<p>with $e = 2.7182818...$ being Euler's constant.</p>

<p>It can be shown that $a(n)$ is of the form $\dfrac{A(n)e + B(n)}{n!}$ for integers $A(n)$ and $B(n)$.</p>

<h1>Problem 333</h1>
<p>All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every term of the partition can be expressed as $2^i \times 3^j$, where $i,j \ge 0$.</p>

<p>Let's consider only such partitions where none of the terms can divide any of the other terms.
<br>For example, the partition of $17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2^1 \times 3^0 + 2^1 \times 3^1 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$ would not be valid since $2$ can divide $6$. Neither would the partition $17 = 16 + 1 = (2^4 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^0)$ since $1$ can divide $16$. The only valid partition of $17$ would be $8 + 9 = (2^3 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$.</p>

<p>Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being $11$ having the following two partitions.
<br>$11 = 2 + 9 = (2^1 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$
<br>$11 = 8 + 3 = (2^3 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^1)$</p>

<p>Let's define $P(n)$ as the number of valid partitions of $n$. For example, $P(11) = 2$.</p>

<p>Let's consider only the prime integers $q$ which would have a single valid partition such as $P(17)$.</p>

<p>The sum of the primes $q \lt 100$ such that $P(q)=1$ equals $233$.</p>

<h1>Problem 334</h1>
<p>In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.<br>
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.<br>
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.<br> The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.</p>

<p>For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing $2$ and $3$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0334_beans.gif?1678992056" class="dark_img" alt="0334_beans.gif"></div>

<p>The first two terms of the last sequence are $b_1 = 289$ and $b_2 = 145$.<br>
If we start with $b_1$ and $b_2$ beans in two adjacent bowls, $3419100$ moves would be required to finish the game.</p>

<p>Consider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{1500}$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes before the game ends.</p>

<h1>Problem 335</h1>
<p>Whenever Peter feels bored, he places some bowls, containing one bean each, in a circle. After this, he takes all the beans out of a certain bowl and drops them one by one in the bowls going clockwise.

<div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0335_mancala.gif?1678992056" class="dark_img" alt="0335_mancala.gif"></div>

<p>So with $5$ bowls it takes Peter $15$ moves to return to the initial situation.</p>

<h1>Problem 336</h1>
<p>A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. <br />
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.<br />
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.</p>

<p>However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.</p>

<p>Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call <i>maximix arrangements</i>, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.</p>

<h1>Problem 346</h1>
<p>
The number $7$ is special, because $7$ is $111$ written in base $2$, and $11$ written in base $6$ (i.e. $7_{10} = 11_6 = 111_2$). In other words, $7$ is a repunit in at least two bases $b \gt 1$. 
</p>
<p>
We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be verified that there are $8$ strong repunits below $50$: $\{1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43\}$.<br>
Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below $1000$ equals $15864$.

<h1>Problem 347</h1>
<p>
The largest integer $\le 100$ that is only divisible by both the primes $2$ and $3$ is $96$, as $96=32\times 3=2^5 \times 3$.
For two <i>distinct</i> primes $p$ and $q$ let $M(p,q,N)$ be the largest positive integer $\le N$ only divisible by both $p$ and $q$ and $M(p,q,N)=0$ if such a positive integer does not exist.
</p>
<p>
E.g. $M(2,3,100)=96$.<br> 
$M(3,5,100)=75$ and not $90$ because $90$ is divisible by $2$, $3$ and $5$.<br>
Also $M(2,73,100)=0$ because there does not exist a positive integer $\le 100$ that is divisible by both $2$ and $73$.

<h1>Problem 348</h1>
<p>Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.</p>

<p>Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than $1$, in <b>exactly</b> $4$ different ways.<br>
For example, $5229225$ is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly $4$ different ways:</p>

<h1>Problem 349</h1>
<p>
An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or white.<br> 
The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following rules:<br>
- if it is on a black square, it flips the colour of the square to white, rotates $90$ degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.<br>
- if it is on a white square, it flips the colour of the square to black, rotates $90$ degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.<br></p>
<p>
Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after $10^{18}$ moves of the ant?

<h1>Problem 350</h1>
<p>A <dfn>list of size $n$</dfn> is a sequence of $n$ natural numbers.<br> Examples are $(2,4,6)$, $(2,6,4)$, $(10,6,15,6)$, and $(11)$.
</p><p>
The <strong>greatest common divisor</strong>, or $\gcd$, of a list is the largest natural number that divides all entries of the list. <br>Examples: $\gcd(2,6,4) = 2$, $\gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1$ and $\gcd(11) = 11$.

$f(10, 100, 2) = 327$.<br>
$f(10, 100, 3) = 1135$.<br>
$f(10, 100, 1000) \bmod 101^4 = 3286053$.

<h1>Problem 351</h1>
<p>A <dfn>hexagonal orchard</dfn> of order $n$ is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side $n$. The following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order $5$:

</p>

<p>
$H(5) = 30$. $H(10) = 138$. $H(1\,000) = 1177848$.

</p>

<h1>Problem 352</h1>
<p>
Each one of the $25$ sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect $2\%$ of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.
</p>

<p>
Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing $25$ separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:<br><br>
The sheep are split into $5$ groups of $5$ sheep in each group. 
For each group, the $5$ samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,
</p><ul><li>If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.</li>
<li>If the result is positive, $5$ additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).</li>
</ul><p>
Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only $0.02$, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
</p><ul><li>Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability $0.98^5 = 0.9039207968$.</li>
<li>Positive ($5$ additional tests needed) with probability $1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032$.</li>
</ul><p>
Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is $1 + 0.0960792032 \times 5 = 1.480396016$.<br>
Consequently, all $5$ groups can be screened using an average of only $1.480396016 \times 5 = \mathbf{7.40198008}$ tests, which represents a huge saving of more than $70\%$!
</p>

<p>
Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:
</p><ul><li>We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the $25$ samples. It can be verified that in about $60.35\%$ of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining $39.65\%$ of the cases.</li>
<li>If we know that at least one animal in a group of $5$ is infected and the first $4$ individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).</li>
<li>We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.</li>
</ul><p>
To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.
</p>
For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the <dfn>optimal strategy</dfn>) requires an average of just $\mathbf{4.155452}$ tests!


<p>
Using the optimal strategy, let $T(s,p)$ represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of $s$ sheep for a virus having probability $p$ to be present in any individual.<br>
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, $T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452$ and $T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124$.
</p>

<p>
Find $\sum T(10000, p)$ for $p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, \dots 0.50$.<br>
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

<h1>Problem 353</h1>
<p>
A moon could be described by the sphere $C(r)$ with centre $(0,0,0)$ and radius $r$. 
</p>

<p>
There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of $C(r)$ with integer coordinates. The station at $(0,0,r)$ is called North Pole station, the station at $(0,0,-r)$ is called South Pole station.
</p>

<p>
All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky. If <var>d</var> is the length of the road between two stations, $\left(\frac{d}{\pi r}\right)^2$ is a measure for the risk of the journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes more than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of the used roads.
</p>

<p>
A direct journey from  the North Pole station to the South Pole station has the length $\pi r$ and risk $1$. The journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station via $(0,r,0)$ has the same length, but a smaller risk:</p>
\[
\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\frac{1}{2}\pi r}{\pi r}\right)^2=0.5
\]

<p>
The minimal risk of a journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station on $C(r)$ is $M(r)$.

<h1>Problem 359</h1>
<p>
An infinite number of people (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.) are lined up to get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.). 
</p>

<p>
Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the $n$<sup>th</sup> person is assigned a room: person $n$ gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:
</p><ul><li>the floor is empty</li>
<li>the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person $m$, then $m + n$ is a perfect square</li>
</ul><p>
Person $1$ gets room $1$ in floor $1$ since floor $1$ is empty.
<br>Person $2$ does not get room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 2 = 3$ is not a perfect square.
<br>Person $2$ instead gets room $1$ in floor $2$ since floor $2$ is empty.
<br>Person $3$ gets room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 3 = 4$ is a perfect square.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
Define $P(f, r)$ to be $n$ if person $n$ occupies room $r$ in floor $f$, and $0$ if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
<br>$P(1, 1) = 1$

<h1>Problem 366</h1>

Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.<br>
There is one pile of $n$ stones.<br>
The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the whole pile.<br>
Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his opponent took on the previous move.<br>
The player who removes the last stone wins.
</p>
<p>
E.g. $n=5$.<br>
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be able to take all remaining stones.<br>
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take also one stone, leaving three stones.<br>
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most $2 \times 1=2$ stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving $2$. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.<br>
So $5$ is a losing position for the first player.<br>
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.<br>
E.g. when $n=17$ the first player can remove one or four stones.
</p>
<p>
Let $M(n)$ be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position <i>at his first turn</i> and $M(n)=0$ for any other position.

<p>Let $s_k$ be the number of 1’s when writing the numbers from 0 to $k$ in binary.<br />
For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have $0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101$. There are seven 1’s, so $s_5 = 7$.<br />
The sequence $S = \{s_k : k \ge 0\}$ starts $\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...\}$.</p>

<p>A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number $n$ is chosen. A counter $c$ starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a number from 1 to $n$ (inclusive) and increases $c$ by that number. The resulting value of $c$ must be a member of $S$. If there are no more valid moves, then the player loses.</p>

<p>For example, with $n = 5$ and starting with $c = 0$:</p>
<p>Player 1 chooses 4, so $c$ becomes $0 + 4 = 4$.<br />
Player 2 chooses 5, so $c$ becomes $4 + 5 = 9$.<br />
Player 1 chooses 3, so $c$ becomes $9 + 3 = 12$.<br />
etc.</p>
<p>Note that $c$ must always belong to $S$, and each player can increase $c$ by at most $n$.</p>

- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border equally likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.<br>

Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br></p><ul><li> "Your guess is lower than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of $a$), or</li>
<li> "Your guess is higher than the hidden number" (and you incur a cost of $b$), or</li>
<li> "Yes, that's it!" (and the game ends).</li>
</ul><p>Given the value of $n$, $a$, and $b$, an <dfn>optimal strategy</dfn> minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p>

<p>For example, if $n = 5$, $a = 2$, and $b = 3$, then we may begin by asking "<b>2</b>" as our first question.</p>

<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that "<b>1</b>" is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style="color:#3333ff;"><b>3</b></span>).<br>
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be "<b>4</b>".<br>
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that "<b>3</b>" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style="color:#3333ff;"><b>5</b></span>).<br>
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that "<b>5</b>" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style="color:#3333ff;"><b>4</b></span>).<br>
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style="color:#FF0000;"><b>5</b></span>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. 
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and $b$.</p>

<h1>Problem 410</h1>
<p>Let $C$ be the circle with radius $r$, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. We choose two points $P(a, b)$ and $Q(-a, c)$ so that the line passing through $P$ and $Q$ is tangent to $C$.</p>

<p>For example, the quadruplet $(r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7)$ satisfies this property.</p>

<p>Let $F(R, X)$ be the number of the integer quadruplets $(r, a, b, c)$ with this property, and with $0 \lt r \leq R$ and $0 \lt a \leq X$.</p>

<h1>Problem 411</h1>
<p>
Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates $(x, y) = (2^i \bmod n, 3^i \bmod n)$ for $0 \leq i \leq 2n$. We will consider stations with the same coordinates as the same station.
</p><p>
We wish to form a path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ such that the $x$ and $y$ coordinates never decrease.<br>
Let $S(n)$ be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass through.
</p><p>
For example, if $n = 22$, there are $11$ distinct stations, and a valid path can pass through at most $5$ stations. Therefore, $S(22) = 5$.
The case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:

<h1>Problem 412</h1>
<p>For integers $m, n$ ($0 \leq n \lt m$), let $L(m, n)$ be an $m \times m$ grid with the top-right $n \times n$ grid removed.</p>

<p>For example, $L(5, 3)$ looks like this:</p>

<p class="center"><img src="resources/images/0412_table53.png?1678992053" alt="0412_table53.png"></p>

<p>We want to number each cell of $L(m, n)$ with consecutive integers $1, 2, 3, \dots$ such that the number in every cell is smaller than the number below it and to the left of it.</p>

<p>For example, here are two valid numberings of $L(5, 3)$:</p>
<p class="center"><img src="resources/images/0412_tablenums.png?1678992053" alt="0412_tablenums.png"></p>

<p>Let $\operatorname{LC}(m, n)$ be the number of valid numberings of $L(m, n)$.<br>
It can be verified that $\operatorname{LC}(3, 0) = 42$, $\operatorname{LC}(5, 3) = 250250$, $\operatorname{LC}(6, 3) = 406029023400$ and $\operatorname{LC}(10, 5) \bmod 76543217 = 61251715$.</p>

<h1>Problem 413</h1>
<p>We say that a $d$-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a one-child number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by $d$.</p>

<p>For example, $5671$ is a $4$-digit one-child number. Among all its sub-strings $5$, $6$, $7$, $1$, $56$, $67$, $71$, $567$, $671$ and $5671$, only $56$ is divisible by $4$.<br>
Similarly, $104$ is a $3$-digit one-child number because only $0$ is divisible by $3$.<br>
$1132451$ is a $7$-digit one-child number because only $245$ is divisible by $7$.</p>

<p>Let $F(N)$ be the number of the one-child numbers less than $N$.<br>
We can verify that $F(10) = 9$, $F(10^3) = 389$ and $F(10^7) = 277674$.</p>

<p>Find $F(10^{19})$.</p>

<h1>Problem 414</h1>
<p>
$6174$ is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get $7641-1467=6174$.<br>
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any $4$ digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with $6174$ or immediately with $0$ if all digits are equal.<br> 
This also works with numbers that have less than $4$ digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have $4$ digits.<br>
E.g. let's start with the number $0837$:<br>
$8730-0378=8352$<br>
$8532-2358=6174$
</p>
<p>
$6174$ is called the <strong>Kaprekar constant</strong>. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either $0$ or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the <strong>Kaprekar routine</strong>.
</p>
<p>
We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.<br> 
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.<br>
However, it can be shown that for $5$ digits and a base $b = 6t+3\neq 9$, a Kaprekar constant exists.<br>
E.g. base $15$: $(10,4,14,9,5)_{15}$<br>
base $21$: $(14,6,20,13,7)_{21}$</p>
<p>
Define $C_b$ to be the Kaprekar constant in base $b$ for $5$ digits.
Define the function $sb(i)$ to be
</p><ul><li>$0$ if $i = C_b$ or if $i$ written in base $b$ consists of $5$ identical digits
</li><li>the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base $b$ to arrive at $C_b$, otherwise
</li></ul>
Note that we can define $sb(i)$ for all integers $i \lt b^5$. If $i$ written in base $b$ takes less than $5$ digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have $5$ digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.

<p>
Define $S(b)$ as the sum of $sb(i)$ for $0 \lt i \lt b^5$.<br>
E.g. $S(15) = 5274369$<br>
$S(111) = 400668930299$
</p>
<p>
Find the sum of $S(6k+3)$ for $2 \leq k \leq 300$.<br>
Give the last $18$ digits as your answer.

<h1>Problem 415</h1>
<p>A set of lattice points $S$ is called a <dfn>titanic set</dfn> if there exists a line passing through exactly two points in $S$.</p>

<p>An example of a titanic set is $S = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)\}$, where the line passing through $(0, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$ does not pass through any other point in $S$.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the set $\{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)\}$ is not a titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set also passes through the other two.</p>

<p>For any positive integer $N$, let $T(N)$ be the number of titanic sets $S$ whose every point $(x, y)$ satisfies $0 \leq x, y \leq N$.
It can be verified that $T(1) = 11$, $T(2) = 494$, $T(4) = 33554178$, $T(111) \bmod 10^8 = 13500401$ and $T(10^5) \bmod 10^8 = 63259062$.</p>

<h1>Problem 416</h1>
<p>A row of $n$ squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By successive jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to the leftmost square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three squares to the right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a similar manner. He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the round-trip travel $m$ times.</p>

<p>Let $F(m, n)$ be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at most one square remains unvisited.<br>
For example, $F(1, 3) = 4$, $F(1, 4) = 15$, $F(1, 5) = 46$, $F(2, 3) = 16$ and $F(2, 100) \bmod 10^9 = 429619151$.</p>

<p>Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.</p>
<p>
Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than $2$ and/or $5$ are not considered to have a recurring cycle.<br>
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as $0$.

Define $f(n)$ to be $a + b + c$ for the factorisation triple $(a, b, c)$ of $n$ which minimises $c / a$. One can show that this triple is unique.

The sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained by describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.<br>
It helps to do this out loud:<br>
1 is 'one one' → 11<br>
11 is 'two ones' → 21<br>

(The common rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet sites. Other related information can also be currently found at <a href="http://krazydad.com/">krazydad.com</a> whose author has provided the puzzle data for this challenge.)</p>

<p>The downloadable text file (<a href="project/resources/p424_kakuro200.txt">kakuro200.txt</a>) contains the description of 200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first puzzle in the file is the above example which is coded as follows:</p>

<p>The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed to insert information.</p>

<p>The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left to right and starting with the top line.<br />
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.<br />
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.<br />
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.<br />
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case "h" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case "v". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the "tens" and the second one for the "units". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.</p>

<p>The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.</p>

<p>The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must be assigned the remaining digit.</p>

A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.

<h1>Problem 431</h1>
<p>Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.</p>

<p>Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of $6\mathrm m$, the amount of space wasted would be approximately $32.648388556\mathrm{m^3}$. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.</p>

<div class="center">
   <img src="resources/images/0431_grain_silo.png?1678992053" class="dark_img" alt="0431_grain_silo.png"></div>

<p>We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.</p>

<p>Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is $6$ metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is $40$ degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.</p>

<p>If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\sum x$ correct to $9$ decimal places.</p>

<h1>Problem 434</h1>
<p>Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.<br>
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean space.<br>
A <strong>flexible</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.<br>
A <strong>rigid</strong> graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.<br>
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.
</p>
<p>The <strong>grid graphs</strong> embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="resources/images/0434_rigid.gif?1678992057" class="dark_img" alt="0434_rigid.gif"></div>
<p>However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the $2\times 3$ grid graph, there are $19$ ways to make the graph rigid:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="resources/images/0434_rigid23.png?1678992053" class="dark_img" alt="0434_rigid23.png"></div>
<p>Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.
</p>
<p>Let $R(m,n)$ be the number of ways to make the $m \times n$ grid graph rigid. <br>
E.g. $R(2,3) = 19$ and $R(5,5) = 23679901$.

<h1>Problem 437</h1>

When we calculate $8^n$ modulo $11$ for $n=0$ to $9$ we get: $1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7$.<br>
As we see all possible values from $1$ to $10$ occur. So $8$ is a <strong>primitive root</strong> of $11$.<br>
But there is more:<br>
If we take a closer look we see:<br>
$1+8=9$<br>
$8+9=17 \equiv 6 \bmod 11$<br>
$9+6=15 \equiv 4 \bmod 11$<br>
$6+4=10$<br>
$4+10=14 \equiv 3 \bmod 11$<br>
$10+3=13 \equiv 2 \bmod 11$<br>
$3+2=5$<br>
$2+5=7$<br>
$5+7=12 \equiv 1 \bmod 11$.
</p>
So the powers of $8 \bmod 11$ are cyclic with period $10$, and $8^n + 8^{n+1} \equiv 8^{n+2} \pmod{11}$.<br>
$8$ is called a <strong>Fibonacci primitive root</strong> of $11$.<br>

<h1>Problem 460</h1>
<p>
On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point $A(0, 1)$ to point $B(d, 1)$ for an integer $d$.
</p>
<p>
In each step, the ant at point $(x_0, y_0)$ chooses one of the lattice points $(x_1, y_1)$ which satisfy $x_1 \ge 0$ and $y_1 \ge 1$ and goes straight to $(x_1, y_1)$ at a constant velocity $v$. The value of $v$ depends on $y_0$ and $y_1$ as follows:
</p><ul><li> If $y_0 = y_1$, the value of $v$ equals $y_0$.</li>
<li> If $y_0 \ne y_1$, the value of $v$ equals $(y_1 - y_0) / (\ln(y_1) - \ln(y_0))$.</li>
</ul><p>
The left image is one of the possible paths for $d = 4$. First the ant goes from $A(0, 1)$ to $P_1(1, 3)$ at velocity $(3 - 1) / (\ln(3) - \ln(1)) \approx 1.8205$. Then the required time is $\sqrt 5 / 1.8205 \approx 1.2283$.<br>
From $P_1(1, 3)$ to $P_2(3, 3)$ the ant travels at velocity $3$ so the required time is $2 / 3 \approx 0.6667$. From $P_2(3, 3)$ to $B(4, 1)$ the ant travels at velocity $(1 - 3) / (\ln(1) - \ln(3)) \approx 1.8205$ so the required time is $\sqrt 5 / 1.8205 \approx 1.2283$.<br>
Thus the total required time is $1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233$.
</p>
<p>
The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as $0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052$. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for $d = 4$.

<h1>Problem 470</h1>
<p>Consider a single game of Ramvok:</p>

<p>Let $t$ represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If $t = 0$, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn $i$, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if $i \lt t$ the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If $i = t$, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, $t$ is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost $ct$ for some constant $c$. For $c = 0$, $t$ can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of $0$). Let $R(d, c)$ be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided die and cost constant $c$. For example, $R(4, 0.2) = 2.65$. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.</p>

<p>Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:</p>

<p>In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value.

Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$<br>
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\varphi$ is used at most once in this sum.<br>
Even then this representation is not unique.<br>
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents are used and that the representation is finite.<br>
E.g: 
$2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$
</p>
<p>
To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and 1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.<br>
We call this the representation in the <b>phigital numberbase</b>.<br>
So $1=1_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\varphi}$ and $14=100100.001001_{\varphi}$. <br>
The strings representing $1$, $2$ and $14$ in the phigital number base are palindromic, while the string representing $3$ is not.<br> (the phigital point is not the middle character).

<h1>Problem 478</h1>
<p>Let us consider <b>mixtures</b> of three substances: <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b> in it, i.e., $(a : b : c)$. For example, a mixture described by the ratio $(2 : 3 : 5)$ contains $20\%$ <b>A</b>, $30\%$ <b>B</b> and $50\%$ <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.</p>

<p>For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios $(3 : 0 : 2)$, $(3: 6 : 11)$ and $(3 : 3 : 4)$. By mixing $10$ units of the first, $20$ units of the second and $30$ units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio $(6 : 5 : 9)$, since:<br>
$(10 \cdot \tfrac 3 5$ + $20 \cdot \tfrac 3 {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 0 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac 6 {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 2 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac {11} {20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 4 {10})
= (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)$
</p>

<p>However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio $(3 : 2 : 1)$, since the amount of <b>B</b> is always less than the amount of <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$, we have a mixture with ratio $(a : b : c)$. Let $M(n)$ be the set of all such mixtures.</p>

<p>For example, $M(2)$ contains the $19$ mixtures with the following ratios:</p>
\begin{align}
\{&amp;(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2), (0 : 2 : 1),\\
&amp;(1 : 0 : 0), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2), (1 : 1 : 0), (1 : 1 : 1),\\
&amp;(1 : 1 : 2), (1 : 2 : 0), (1 : 2 : 1), (1 : 2 : 2), (2 : 0 : 1),\\
&amp;(2 : 1 : 0), (2 : 1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2), (2 : 2 : 1)\}.
\end{align}

<p>Let $E(n)$ be the number of subsets of $M(n)$ which can produce the mixture with ratio $(1 : 1 : 1)$, i.e., the mixture with equal parts <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>.<br>
We can verify that $E(1) = 103$, $E(2) = 520447$, $E(10) \bmod 11^8 = 82608406$ and $E(500) \bmod 11^8 = 13801403$.<br>

<h1>Problem 481</h1>
<p>A group of chefs (numbered #$1$, #$2$, etc) participate in a turn-based strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let $S(k)$ represent chef #$k$'s skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, $S(k)$ is the probability that chef #$k$'s dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.</p>

<p>The game always begins with chef #$1$, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.</p>

<p>Define $W_n(k)$ as the probability that chef #$k$ wins in a competition with $n$ chefs. If we have $S(1) = 0.25$, $S(2) = 0.5$, and $S(3) = 1$, then $W_3(1) = 0.29375$.</p>

<p>Going forward, we assign $S(k) = F_k/F_{n+1}$ over all $1 \le k \le n$, where $F_k$ is a Fibonacci number: $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$ with base cases $F_1 = F_2 = 1$. Then, for example, when considering a competition with $n = 7$ chefs, we have $W_7(1) = 0.08965042$, $W_7(2) = 0.20775702$, $W_7(3) = 0.15291406$, $W_7(4) = 0.14554098$, $W_7(5) = 0.15905291$, $W_7(6) = 0.10261412$, and $W_7(7) = 0.14247050$, rounded to $8$ decimal places each.</p>

<h1>Problem 494</h1>
<p>
The Collatz sequence is defined as:
$a_{i+1} = \left\{  \large{\frac {a_i} 2 \atop 3 a_i+1} {\text{if }a_i\text{ is even} \atop \text{if }a_i\text{ is odd}} \right.$.
</p>
<p>
The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer, the sequence eventually reaches the cycle $1,4,2,1, \dots$.<br>
We shall define the sequence prefix $p(n)$ for the Collatz sequence starting with $a_1 = n$ as the sub-sequence of all numbers not a power of $2$ ($2^0=1$ is considered a power of $2$ for this problem). For example:<br>$p(13) = \{13, 40, 20, 10, 5\}$ <br>$p(8) = \{\}$<br>
Any number invalidating the conjecture would have an infinite length sequence prefix.
</p>
<p>
Let $S_m$ be the set of all sequence prefixes of length $m$. Two sequences $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m\}$ and $\{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m\}$ in $S_m$ are said to belong to the same prefix family if $a_i \lt a_j$ if and only if $b_i \lt b_j$ for all $1 \le i,j \le m$.
</p>
<p>
For example, in $S_4$, $\{6, 3, 10, 5\}$ is in the same family as $\{454, 227, 682, 341\}$, but not $\{113, 340, 170, 85\}$.<br>
Let $f(m)$ be the number of distinct prefix families in $S_m$.<br>
You are given $f(5) = 5$, $f(10) = 55$, $f(20) = 6771$.

<h1>Problem 495</h1>

<h1>Problem 497</h1>
<p>Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, "Tower of Hanoi," which consists of three upright rods and disks of different sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack of $n$ disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:</p>

<ol><li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
<li>A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod).</li>
<li>No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li>
</ol><p>Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room $k$ units (square tiles) wide, labeled from $1$ to $k$ in ascending order. Three rods are placed at squares $a$, $b$, and $c$, and a stack of $n$ disks is placed on the rod at square $a$.</p>

<p>Bob begins the game standing at square $b$. His objective is to play the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square $c$. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod/stack in question.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.</p>

<p>The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for $n = 3$, $k = 7$, $a = 2$, $b = 4$, and $c = 6$:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="resources/images/0497_hanoi.gif?1678992057" alt="0497_hanoi.gif"></p>

<p>Let $E(n, k, a, b, c)$ be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example, $E(2,5,1,3,5) = 60$ and $E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358$.</p>

<h1>Problem 498</h1>

<h1>Problem 499</h1>
<p>A gambler decides to participate in a special lottery. In this lottery the gambler plays a series of one or more games.<br>
Each game costs $m$ pounds to play and starts with an initial pot of $1$ pound. The gambler flips an unbiased coin. Every time a head appears, the pot is doubled and the gambler continues. When a tail appears, the game ends and the gambler collects the current value of the pot. The gambler is certain to win at least $1$ pound, the starting value of the pot, at the cost of $m$ pounds, the initial fee.</p>

<p>The game ends if the gambler's fortune falls below $m$ pounds.

(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left, she is forced to end the game.<br></p>

<h1>Problem 514</h1>
<p>A <strong>geoboard</strong> (of order $N$) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates $0 \le x, y \le N$.</p>

<p>John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between $1$ and $N+1$ (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is equal to $1$ for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.</p>

<p>After John is finished generating numbers for all $(N+1)^2$ holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let $S$ represent the shape that is formed. $S$ can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.</p>

<h1>Problem 522</h1>
<p>Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.</p> 

<p>To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.</p>

<p>For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="resources/images/0522_hilberts_blackout.png?1678992053" alt="0522_hilberts_blackout.png"></p>

<p>If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can <i>receive</i> power from many other floors at once, it can only <i>send</i> power to one other floor.</p>

<p>To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.</p>

<p>Let $F(n)$ be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of $n$ floors. For example, $F(3) = 6$, $F(8) = 16276736$, and $F(100) \bmod 135707531 = 84326147$.</p>

<p>Find $F(12344321) \bmod 135707531$.</p>

<h1>Problem 527</h1>
<p>A secret integer $t$ is selected at random within the range $1 \le t \le n$. </p>

<p>The goal is to guess the value of $t$ by making repeated guesses, via integer $g$. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either $g \lt t$, $g = t$, or $g \gt t$. Then the process can repeat as necessary.</p>

<p>Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound $L$ and upper bound $H$ (initialized to $L = 1$ and $H = n$), let $g = \lfloor(L+H)/2\rfloor$ where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the integer floor function. If $g = t$, the process ends. Otherwise, if $g \lt t$, set $L = g+1$, but if $g \gt t$ instead, set $H = g - 1$. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once $t$ is found. Even if $t$ can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.</p>

<p>Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting $g = \lfloor(L+H)/2\rfloor$, simply let $g$ be a random integer between $L$ and $H$, inclusive. The rest of the algorithm is the same as the standard binary search. This new search routine will be referred to as a <dfn>random binary search</dfn>.</p>

<p>Given that $1 \le t \le n$ for random $t$, let $B(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the standard binary search, and let $R(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the random binary search. For example, $B(6) = 2.33333333$ and $R(6) = 2.71666667$ when rounded to $8$ decimal places.</p>

<h1>Problem 532</h1>
<p>Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by giving them a ball coloured by his new nanobots as a present.</p>

<p>His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.</p>

<p>Now Bob places $n$ bots on the ball (with radius $1$) equidistantly on a small circle with radius $0.999$ and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle.

<h1>Problem 534</h1>
<p>The classical <b>eight queens puzzle</b> is the well known problem of placing eight chess queens on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored form, a total of $92$ distinct configurations can be found for eight queens. The general case asks for the number of distinct ways of placing $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ board, e.g. you can find $2$ distinct configurations for $n=4$.</p>

<p>Let's define a <dfn>weak queen</dfn> on an $n \times n$ board to be a piece which can move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of $n - 1 - w$ squares if moved vertically or diagonally, $0 \le w \lt n$ being the "weakness factor". For example, a weak queen on an $n \times n$ board with a weakness factor of $w=1$ located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move $n - 1$ squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move $n - 2$ squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its current position in that row.</p>

<p>Let $Q(n,w)$ be the number of ways $n$ weak queens with weakness factor $w$ can be placed on an $n \times n$ board so that no two queens threaten each other. It can be shown, for example, that $Q(4,0)=2$, $Q(4,2)=16$ and $Q(4,3)=256$.</p>

<h1>Problem 556</h1>
<p>A <b>Gaussian integer</b> is a number $z = a + bi$ where $a$, $b$ are integers and $i^2 = -1$.<br>
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are the subset of Gaussian integers for which $b = 0$.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer <strong>unit</strong> is one for which $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, i.e. one of $1, i, -1, -i$.<br>
Let's define a <dfn>proper</dfn> Gaussian integer as one for which $a \gt 0$ and $b \ge 0$.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer $z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i$ is said to be divisible by $z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i$ if $z_3 = a_3 + b_3 i = z_1 / z_2$ is a Gaussian integer.<br>
$\frac {z_1} {z_2} = \frac {a_1 + b_1 i} {a_2 + b_2 i} = \frac {(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} {(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i)} = \frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2} + \frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}i = a_3 + b_3 i$<br>
So, $z_1$ is divisible by $z_2$ if $\frac {a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2} {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ and $\frac  {a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}  {a_2^2 + b_2^2}$ are integers.<br>
For example, $2$ is divisible by $1 + i$ because $2/(1 + i) = 1 - i$ is a Gaussian integer.</p>

<p>A <strong>Gaussian prime</strong> is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.<br>
For example, $1 + 2i$ is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$, $1 + 2i$, $i(1 + 2i) = i - 2$, $-(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i$ and $-i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i$.<br>
$2$ is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by $1 + i$.</p>

<p>A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.<br>
For example $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$.<br>
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.<br>
So $2$ is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but $1 + 3i$ is.<br>
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.</p>

<p>Let $f(n)$ be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with $a^2 + b^2 \le n$.<br>
For example $f(10) = 7$ because $1$, $1 + i$, $1 + 2i$, $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$, $2 + i$, $3$ and $3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i)$ are squarefree, while $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)^3$ are not.<br>
You are given $f(10^2) = 54$, $f(10^4) = 5218$ and $f(10^8) = 52126906$.</p>

<p>Find $f(10^{14})$.</p>


<h1>Problem 557</h1>
<p>
A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral.  If the original triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such that all of the four pieces also have integral area.  For example, the diagram below shows a triangle of area $55$ that has been cut in this way.
</p>
<div align="center"><img src="resources/images/0557-triangle.gif?1678992057" alt="0557-triangle.gif"></div>
<p>
Representing the areas as $a, b, c$ and $d$, in the example above, the individual areas are $a = 22$, $b = 8$, $c = 11$ and $d = 14$.  It is also possible to cut a triangle of area $55$ such that $a = 20$, $b = 2$, $c = 24$, $d = 9$.</p>
<p>
Define a triangle cutting quadruple $(a, b, c, d)$ as a valid integral division of a triangle, where $a$ is the area of the triangle between the two cut vertices, $d$ is the area of the quadrilateral and $b$ and $c$ are the areas of the two other triangles, with the restriction that $b \le c$.  The two solutions described above are $(22,8,11,14)$ and $(20,2,24,9)$.  These are the only two possible quadruples that have a total area of $55$.
</p>
<p>
Define $S(n)$ as the sum of the area of the uncut triangles represented by all valid quadruples with $a+b+c+d \le n$.<br> For example, $S(20) = 259$.

<h1>Problem 558</h1>
<p>Let $r$ be the real root of the equation $x^3 = x^2 + 1$.<br>
Every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct increasing powers of $r$.<br>
If we require the number of terms to be finite and the difference between any two exponents to be three or more, then the representation is unique.<br>
For example, $3 = r^{-10} + r^{-5} + r^{-1} + r^2$ and $10 = r^{-10} + r^{-7} + r^6$.<br>

<h1>Problem 563</h1>
<p>A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to $25$ identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including $25$), and whether to weld the long or short edge.</p>

<p>For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together $11$ raw unit square plates to make a $11 \times 1$ strip. The next could take $10$ of these $11 \times 1$ strips, and weld them either to make a longer $110 \times 1$ strip, or a $11 \times 10$ rectangle. Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.</p>

<p>One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than $10\%$ larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area $889200$, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: $900 \times 988$, $912 \times 975$ and $936 \times 950$. The target area of $889200$ is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.</p>

<p>Let $M(n)$ be the minimal area that can be manufactured in <u>exactly</u> $n$ variants with the longer edge not greater than $10\%$ bigger than the shorter edge. Hence $M(3) = 889200$.</p>

<p>A line segment of length $2n-3$ is randomly split into $n$ segments of integer length ($n \ge 3$). In the sequence given by this split, the segments are then used as consecutive sides of a convex $n$-polygon, formed in such a way that its area is maximal.  All of the $\binom{2n-4} {n-1}$ possibilities for splitting up the initial line segment occur with the same probability. </p>

<p>Let $E(n)$ be the expected value of the area that is obtained by this procedure.<br>
For example, for $n=3$ the only possible split of the line segment of length $3$ results in three line segments with length $1$, that form an equilateral triangle with an area of $\frac 1 4 \sqrt{3}$. Therefore $E(3)=0.433013$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.<br>
For $n=4$ you can find $4$ different possible splits, each of which is composed of three line segments with length $1$ and one line segment with length $2$. All of these splits lead to the same maximal quadrilateral with an area of $\frac 3 4 \sqrt{3}$, thus $E(4)=1.299038$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.</p>

<li> The product $AB$ is divisible by every prime less than q.</li>

</ul><p>It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B&lt;q^2$ and any difference $1&lt;A-B&lt;q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that a number $p$ is prime by showing that either $p=A+B&lt;q^2$ or $p=A-B&lt;q^2$ for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the conditions listed above.</p>

<p>Let $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum $p=A+B$ and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime. Examples:<br>

<h1>Problem 575</h1>
<p>It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.</p>

<p>She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png" alt="p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png" /></div>

<p>Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.</p>

<p>Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png" alt="p575_wandering_robot_2_fixed.png" /><br /><div style="font-style:italic;">(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits</div>
<br /><img src="project/images/p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png" alt="p575_wandering_robot_3_dynamic.png" /><br /><div style="font-style:italic;">(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining</div>
</div>

<p>The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.</p>

<p>Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].</p>

<p>In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.<br />

<h1>Problem 584</h1>
<p>A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called "<b>Birthday Problem</b>". The description of the problem was as follows:</p>

<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other</b>.</i></p>

<p>The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.</p>


<p>After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:</p>

<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other</b>.</i></p>

<p>With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka) found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.</p>


<p>This time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in the problem description had changed. It read:</p>

<p><i>If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find <b>4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other</b>.</i></p>

<p>What would be the answer (rounded to eight places after the decimal point) the people of Earth have to enter into the device for a year with 365 days? Ignore leap years. Also assume that all birthdays are equally likely and independent of each other.</p>

<p>Consider the term $\small \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$ that is representing a <strong>nested square root</strong>. $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive integers and $y$ and $z$ are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the outer square root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some combinations of $x$, $y$ and $z$ the given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of simple square roots of integers, actually <strong>denesting</strong> the square roots in the initial expression. </p>

<p>Here are some examples of this denesting:<br>
$\small \sqrt{3+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{1}=\sqrt{2}+1$<br>
$\small \sqrt{8+\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{15}}=\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{3}$<br>

$\small \sqrt{28+\sqrt{160}+\sqrt{108}}=\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{2}$</p>
<p>As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be perfect squares resulting in further simplification.</p>

<p>Let F($n$) be the number of different terms $\small \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$, that can be denested into the sum and/or difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional condition that $0&lt;x \le n$. That is,<br>
$\small \displaystyle \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}=\sum_{i=1}^k s_i\sqrt{a_i}$<br>
with $k$, $x$, $y$, $z$ and all $a_i$ being positive integers, all $s_i =\pm 1$ and $x\le n$.<br> Furthermore $y$ and $z$  are not allowed to be perfect squares.</p>

<p>Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for example $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{27}}$, $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{12}+\sqrt{12}}$ and $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{27}+\sqrt{3}}$, that can all three be denested into $\small 2+\sqrt{3}$, would only be counted once.</p>

<h1>Problem 589</h1>
<p>
Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.
</p>
<p>
On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.
</p>
<p>
The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be $E(m,n)$. Hence $E(60,30)=1036.15...$

For a polygon $P$, let $t(P)$ be the number of ways in which $P$ can be tiled using rhombi and squares with edge length 1. Distinct rotations and reflections are counted as separate tilings.
</p>
<p>
For example, if $O$ is a regular octagon with edge length 1, then $t(O) = 8$. As it happens, all these 8 tilings are rotations of one another:

<h1>Problem 595</h1>
<p>
A deck of cards numbered from $1$ to $n$ is shuffled randomly such that each permutation is equally likely.
</p>
<p>
The cards are to be sorted into ascending order using the following technique:
</p><ol>
<li> Look at the initial sequence of cards.  If it is already sorted, then there is no need for further action.  Otherwise, if any subsequences of cards happen to be in the correct place relative to one another (ascending with no gaps), then those subsequences are fixed by attaching the cards together.  For example, with $7$ cards initially in the order 4123756, the cards labelled 1, 2 and 3 would be attached together, as would 5 and 6.
</li></ol>
<ol start="2">
<li> The cards are 'shuffled' by being thrown into the air, but note that any correctly sequenced cards remain attached, so their orders are maintained.  The cards (or bundles of attached cards) are then picked up randomly.  You should assume that this randomisation is unbiased, despite the fact that some cards are single, and others are grouped together. 
</li></ol>
<ol start="3">
<li> Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the cards are sorted. 
</li></ol>

<p>
   Let $S(n)$ be the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the cards. Since the order is checked before the first shuffle, $S(1) = 0$. You are given that $S(2) = 1$, and $S(5) = 4213/871$.

<h1>Problem 597</h1>
The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:

<ul><li>
A division consists of $n$ boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.
</li><li>
All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.
</li><li>
The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.
</li><li>
Each boat continues rowing until <em>either</em> it reaches the finish line <em>or</em> it catches up with ("bumps") a boat in front.
</li><li>
The finish line is a distance $L$ metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)
</li><li>
When a "bump" occurs, the "bumping" boat takes no further part in the race. The "bumped" boat must continue, however, and may even be "bumped" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.
</li><li>
After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat $A$ that started in a lower place than $B$, then $A$ will be placed higher than $B$ in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:
  <ol><li> $A$ bumped $B$ directly </li>
  <li> $A$ bumped another boat that went on to bump $B$ </li>
  <li> $A$ bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that bumped $B$ </li>
  <li> etc </li></ol></li></ul><b>NOTE</b>: For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats' lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)

<p>
Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B_j$ rows at a steady speed $v_j = -$log$X_j$ metres per second, where the $X_j$ are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.
</p>
<p>
Let $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an <b>even permutation</b> of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the division and $L$ is the course length.
</p>
<p>
For example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as $A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:
</p>
<table cellspacing="15" align="center"><tr><th> Bumps occurring </th>
  <th> New order </th>
  <th> Permutation </th>
  <th> Probability </th>
 </tr><tr align="center"><td> none </td>
  <td> $A$, $B$, $C$ </td>
  <td> even </td>
  <td> $4/15$ </td>
 </tr><tr align="center"><td> $B$ bumps $C$ </td>
  <td> $A$, $C$, $B$ </td>
  <td> odd </td>
  <td> $8/45$ </td>
 </tr><tr align="center"><td> $A$ bumps $B$ </td>
  <td> $B$, $A$, $C$ </td>
  <td> odd </td>
  <td> $1/3$ </td>
 </tr><tr align="center"><td>     $B$ bumps $C$, then $A$ bumps $C$     </td>
  <td> $C$, $A$, $B$ </td>
  <td> even </td>
  <td> $4/27$ </td>
 </tr><tr align="center"><td>     $A$ bumps $B$, then $B$ bumps $C$     </td>
  <td> $C$, $B$, $A$ </td>
  <td> odd </td>
  <td> $2/27$ </td>
 </tr></table><p>
Therefore, $p(3,160) = 4/15 + 4/27 = 56/135$.
</p>
<p>
You are also given that $p(4,400)=0.5107843137$, rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.

<h1>Problem 598</h1>

Consider the number $48$.<br>

<h1>Problem 599</h1>
<p>
The well-known <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong> puzzle has many fascinating mathematical properties. The 2×2×2 variant has 8 cubelets with a total of 24 visible faces, each with a coloured sticker. Successively turning faces will rearrange the cubelets, although not all arrangements of cubelets are reachable without dismantling the puzzle.
</p>
<p>
Suppose that we wish to apply new stickers to a 2×2×2 Rubik's cube in a non-standard colouring. Specifically, we have $n$ different colours available (with an unlimited supply of stickers of each colour), and we place one sticker on each of the 24 faces in any arrangement that we please. We are not required to use all the colours, and if desired the same colour may appear in more than one face of a single cubelet.
</p>
<p>
We say that two such colourings $c_1,c_2$ are <em>essentially distinct</em> if a cube coloured according to $c_1$ cannot be made to match a cube coloured according to $c_2$ by performing mechanically possible Rubik's Cube moves.
</p>
<p>
For example, with two colours available, there are 183 essentially distinct colourings.

<p>
How many essentially distinct colourings are there with 10 different colours available?

<h1>Problem 601</h1>
<p>
For every positive number $n$ we define the function $\mathop{streak}(n)=k$ as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $n+k$ is not divisible by $k+1$.<br>
E.g:<br>
$13$ is divisible by $1$<br>
$14$ is divisible by $2$<br>
$15$ is divisible by $3$<br>
$16$ is divisible by $4$<br>
$17$ is NOT divisible by $5$<br>
So $\mathop{streak}(13) = 4$. <br> 
Similarly:<br>
$120$ is divisible by $1$<br>
$121$ is NOT divisible by $2$<br>
So $\mathop{streak}(120) = 1$.</p>
<p>

Define $P(s, N)$ to be the number of integers $n$, $1 \lt n \lt N$, for which $\mathop{streak}(n) = s$.<br>

<h1>Problem 602</h1>
<p>
Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.
</p>
<p>
As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes <b>THHH—TTTT—THHT—H</b> beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore $2\times 2\times 1 = 4$.
</p>
<p>
Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that, for any fixed $n$, $e(n, p)$ is always a polynomial in $p$. For example, $e(3, p) = p^3 + 4p^2 + p$.
</p>
<p>
Define $c(n, k)$ to be the coefficient of $p^k$ in the polynomial $e(n, p)$. So $c(3, 1) = 1$, $c(3, 2) = 4$, and $c(3, 3) = 1$.

<h1>Problem 605</h1>
<p>Consider an $n$-player game played in consecutive pairs: Round $1$ takes place between players $1$ and $2$, round $2$ takes place between players $2$ and $3$, and so on and so forth, all the way up to round $n$, which takes place between players $n$ and $1$.

<h1>Problem 607</h1>

Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:
</p>

<div class="center">

<p>
The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.
</p>
<p>
If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.

Each item in the sequence is determined by selecting one of these symbols at random, independently of the other items in the sequence. At each step, the seven letters are equally likely to be selected, with probability 14% each, but the <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">#</span> symbol only has a 2% chance of selection.</p>

<p>We write down the sequence of letters from left to right as they are generated, and we stop at the first occurrence of the <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">#</span> symbol (without writing it). However, we stipulate that what we have written down must always (when non-empty) be a valid Roman numeral representation in minimal form. If appending the next letter would contravene this then we simply skip it and try again with the next symbol generated.</p>

<p>Please take careful note of <a href="about=roman_numerals">About...

The subtractive combination <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">IL</span> is invalid because of rule (ii), while <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">XXXXIX</span> is valid but not minimal. The rules do not place any restriction on the number of occurrences of <span style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;">M</span>, so all positive integers have a valid representation.

<h1>Problem 616</h1>
<p>Alice plays the following game, she starts with a list of integers $L$ and on each step she can either:
</p><ul><li>remove two elements $a$ and $b$ from $L$ and add $a^b$ to $L$</li>
<li>or conversely remove an element $c$ from $L$ that can be written as $a^b$, with $a$ and $b$ being two integers such that $a, b &gt; 1$, and add both $a$ and $b$ to $L$</li></ul> 
<p>For example starting from the list $L=\{8\}$, Alice can remove $8$ and add $2$ and $3$ resulting in $L=\{2,3\}$ in a first step. Then she can obtain $L=\{9\}$ in a second step.</p>

<p>Note that the same integer is allowed to appear multiple times in the list.</p>

<p>An integer $n&gt;1$ is said to be <dfn>creative</dfn> if for any integer $m \gt 1$ Alice can obtain a list that contains $m$ starting from $L=\{n\}$.

<h1>Problem 617</h1>
<p>For two integers $n,e \gt 1$, we define an <dfn>$(n,e)$-MPS (Mirror Power Sequence)</dfn> to be an infinite sequence of integers $(a_i)_{i\ge 0}$ such that for all $i\ge 0$, $a_{i+1} = \min(a_i^e,n-a_i^e)$ and $a_i \gt 1$.<br> Examples of such sequences are the two $(18,2)$-MPS sequences made of alternating $2$ and $4$.</p>

<p>Note that even though such a sequence is uniquely determined by $n,e$ and $a_0$, for most values such a sequence does not exist. For example, no $(n,e)$-MPS exists for $n \lt 6$.</p>

<p>Define $C(n)$ to be the number of $(n,e)$-MPS for some $e$, and $\displaystyle D(N) = \sum_{n=2}^N C(n)$.
<br>You are given that $D(10) = 2$, $D(100) = 21$, $D(1000) = 69$, $D(10^6) = 1303$ and $D(10^{12}) = 1014800$.</p>

<h1>Problem 618</h1>
<p>Consider the numbers $15$, $16$ and $18$:<br>
$15=3\times 5$ and $3+5=8$.<br>
$16 = 2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ and $2+2+2+2=8$.<br>
$18 = 2\times 3\times 3$ and $2+3+3=8$.<br> 

$15$, $16$ and $18$ are the only numbers that have $8$ as sum of the prime factors (counted with multiplicity).</p>
<p>
We define $S(k)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n$ where the sum of the prime factors (with multiplicity)  of $n$ is $k$.<br>
Hence $S(8) = 15+16+18 = 49$.<br>

<h1>Problem 619</h1>
<p>For a set of positive integers $\{a, a+1, a+2, \dots , b\}$, let $C(a,b)$ be the number of non-empty subsets in which the product of all elements is a perfect square.</p>
<p>For example $C(5,10)=3$, since the products of all elements of $\{5, 8, 10\}$, $\{5, 8, 9, 10\}$ and $\{9\}$ are perfect squares, and no other subsets of $\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ have this property.</p>

<h1>Problem 620</h1>
<p>A circle $C$ of circumference $c$ centimetres has a smaller circle $S$ of circumference $s$ centimetres lying off-centre within it. Four other distinct circles, which we call "planets", with circumferences $p$, $p$, $q$, $q$ centimetres respectively ($p&lt;q$), are inscribed within $C$ but outside $S$, with each planet touching both $C$ and $S$ tangentially. The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of $S$ and $C$ must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.</p>

<p>Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. $C$ is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$ are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.</p>

<p>Note that "perfectly meshing" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for $S$ and $C$ each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.</p>

<p>Define $g(c,s,p,q)$ to be the number of such gear arrangements for given values of $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$: it turns out that this is finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the above conditions. For example, $g(16,5,5,6)=9$.</p>

<p>Here is one such arrangement:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p620_planetary_gears.png" alt="Example arrangement" /></div>

<p>Let $G(n) = \sum_{s+p+q\le n} g(s+p+q,s,p,q)$ where the sum only includes cases with $p&lt;q$, $p\ge 5$, and $s\ge 5$, all integers. You are given that $G(16)=9$ and $G(20)=205$.</p>

<h1>Problem 621</h1>
<p>Gauss famously proved that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of three <strong>triangular numbers</strong> (including $0$ as the lowest triangular number). In fact most numbers can be expressed as a sum of three triangular numbers in several ways.</p>
<p>
Let $G(n)$ be the number of ways of expressing $n$ as the sum of three triangular numbers, regarding different arrangements of the terms of the sum as distinct.</p>
<p>
For example, $G(9) = 7$, as $9$ can be expressed as: $3+3+3$, $0+3+6$, $0+6+3$, $3+0+6$, $3+6+0$, $6+0+3$, $6+3+0$.<br>

<h1>Problem 622</h1>
<p>
A riffle shuffle is executed as follows: a deck of cards is split into two equal halves, with the top half taken in the left hand and the bottom half taken in the right hand. Next, the cards are interleaved exactly, with the top card in the right half inserted just after the top card in the left half, the 2nd card in the right half just after the 2nd card in the left half, etc. (Note that this process preserves the location of the top and bottom card of the deck)
</p>
<p>
Let $s(n)$ be the minimum number of consecutive riffle shuffles needed to restore a deck of size $n$ to its original configuration, where $n$ is a positive even number.</p>
<p>
Amazingly, a standard deck of $52$ cards will first return to its original configuration after only $8$ perfect shuffles, so $s(52) = 8$. It can be verified that a deck of $86$ cards will also return to its original configuration after exactly $8$ shuffles, and the sum of all values of $n$ that satisfy $s(n) = 8$ is $412$.

Find the sum of all values of n that satisfy $s(n) = 60$.

<h1>Problem 623</h1>
<p>The <strong>lambda-calculus</strong> is a universal model of computation at the core of functional programming languages. It is based on <strong>lambda-terms</strong>, a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any <strong>variable</strong> $x$ (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.</li>
<li>If $M$ and $N$ are lambda-terms, then $(M N)$ is a lambda-term, called the <strong>application</strong> of $M$ to $N$.</li>
<li>If $x$ is a variable and $M$ is a term, then $(\lambda x. M)$ is a lambda-term, called an <strong>abstraction</strong>. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking $x$ as parameter and sending back $M$.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lambda-term $T$ is said to be <strong>closed</strong> if for all variables $x$, all occurrences of $x$ within $T$ are contained within some abstraction $(\lambda x. M)$ in $T$. The smallest such abstraction is said to <strong>bind</strong> the occurrence of the variable $x$. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term $(\lambda x. x)$ is closed, while the term $(\lambda x. (x y))$ is not because $y$ is not bound.</p>

<p>Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that $(\lambda x. x)$ and $(\lambda y. y)$ should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called <i>$\alpha$-equivalent</i>. Note that $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda x. (\lambda x. (x x)))$ are not $\alpha$-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda y. (\lambda x. (y x)))$ are $\alpha$-equivalent.</p>

<p>The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most $15$ symbols, symbols being parenthesis, $\lambda$, dot and variables.</p>

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
(\lambda x.x) &amp; (\lambda x.(x x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.y)) \\
\hline
(\lambda x.(x (x x))) &amp; (\lambda x.((x x) x)) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(x x))) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(x y))) \\
\hline
(\lambda x.(\lambda y.(y x))) &amp; (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(y y))) &amp; (\lambda x.(x (\lambda y.x))) &amp; (\lambda x.(x (\lambda y.y))) \\
\hline

<h1>Problem 626</h1>
<p>A binary matrix is a matrix consisting entirely of $0$s and $1$s. Consider the following transformations that can be performed on a binary matrix:</p>

<h1>Problem 629</h1>
<p>Alice and Bob are playing a modified game of Nim called Scatterstone Nim, with Alice going first, alternating turns with Bob. The game begins with an arbitrary set of stone piles with a total number of stones equal to $n$.</p>

<p>During a player's turn, he/she must pick a pile having at least $2$ stones and perform a split operation, dividing the pile into an arbitrary set of $p$ non-empty, arbitrarily-sized piles where $2 \leq p \leq k$ for some fixed constant $k$. For example, a pile of size $4$ can be split into $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 2\}$, or $\{1, 1, 2\}$ if $k = 3$ and in addition $\{1, 1, 1, 1\}$ if $k = 4$.</p>

<p>If no valid move is possible on a given turn, then the other player wins the game.</p>

<p>A winning position is defined as a set of stone piles where a player can ultimately ensure victory no matter what the other player does.</p>

<p>Let $f(n,k)$ be the number of winning positions for Alice on her first turn, given parameters $n$ and $k$. For example, $f(5, 2) = 3$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}$. In contrast, $f(5, 3) = 5$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{5\}$.</p>

<p>Each turn, Bob rolls both dice, getting numbers $x$ and $y$ respectively, each in the range 1,...,6. He must choose amongst three options: turn over card $x$, card $y$, or card $x+y$. (If the chosen card is already face down, it is turned to face up, and vice versa.)</p>

<p>If Bob manages to have all twelve cards face down at the same time, he wins.</p>

<h1>Problem 644</h1>
<p>Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line segment of length $L$ by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the line segment. </p>

<p>As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either "straight" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or "diagonal" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.<br>
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line segment wins.</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0644_squareline.png?1678992054" alt="0644_squareline.png">
</div>
<p>
With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. </p>
<p>
Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and $L$ if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called $e(L)$, is only dependent on the length of the line segment.</p>
<p>
For example, if $L=2$, Sam will win with a probability of $1$, so $e(2)= 2$. <br>
Choosing $L=4$, the winning probability will be $0.33333333$ for the straight case and $0.22654092$ for the diagonal case, leading to $e(4)=1.11974851$ (rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point each).</p>

It is possible to find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any triangular number, $T_n$, then $AT_n +B$ is always a triangular number. We define $F_3(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$. For example $F_3(100) = 184$.
</p>
<p>
Polygonal numbers are generalisations of triangular numbers. Polygonal numbers with parameter $k$ we call $k$-gonal numbers. The formula for the $n$th $k$-gonal number is $\frac 12n\big(n(k-2)+4-k\big)$ where $n \ge 1$. For example when $k = 3$ we get $\frac 12n(n+1)$ the formula for triangular numbers.
</p>
<p>
The statement above is true for pentagonal, heptagonal and in fact any $k$-gonal number with $k$ odd. For example when $k=5$ we get the pentagonal numbers and we can find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given any pentagonal number, $P_n$, then $AP_n+B$ is always a pentagonal number. We define $F_5(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$.

<p>The game may start with any arrangement of $c$ coins in squares on the board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the same square on the board at the same time.

<h1>Problem 653</h1>
<p>Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length $L$ millimetres, and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open, while the west end is sealed. The tube contains $N$ marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.</p>

<p>Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.</p>

<p>To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence $r_j$ defined by:<br />
$r_1 = 6\,563\,116$<br />
$r_{j+1} = r_j^2 \bmod 32\,745\,673$<br />
The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r_1 \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for $2\le j\le N$, counting from the west, the gap between the $(j-1)$th and $j$th marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by $(r_j \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres.
Furthermore, the $j$th marble is initially moving eastward if $r_j \le 10\,000\,000$, and westward if $r_j &gt; 10\,000\,000$.</p>

<p>For example, with $N=3$, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' <i>centres</i> are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.</p>

<p>Under this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.</p>

<p>Let $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So $d(5000, 3, 2) = 5519$. You are also given that $d(10\,000, 11, 6) = 11\,780$ and $d(100\,000, 101, 51) = 114\,101$.</p>

<p>So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a (biased) coin with probability $p$ of Heads (and hence probability $1-p$ of Tails). If they get Tails, they will continue with the next game. Otherwise they end the match. Also, after every game the players make a note of who is leading in the match.</p>

<p>Let $p_A$ denote the probability of $A$ winning a game and $p_B$ the probability of $B$ winning a game. Accordingly $1-p_A-p_B$ is the probability that a game ends in a draw. Let $\mathbb{E}_A(p_A,p_B,p)$ denote the expected number of times $A$ was leading in the match.<br />

For example, $\mathbb{E}_A(0.25,0.25,0.5)\approx 0.585786$ and $\mathbb{E}_A(0.47,0.48,0.001)\approx 377.471736$, both rounded to six places after the decimal point.</p>

<h1>Problem 666</h1>
Members of a species of bacteria occur in two different types: $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Individual bacteria are capable of multiplying and mutating between the types according to the following rules:
<ul><li>Every minute, each individual will simultaneously undergo some kind of transformation.</li>
<li>Each individual $A$ of type $\alpha$ will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
<ul><li>clone itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type $\alpha$ (alongside $A$ who remains)</li>
<li>split into 3 new bacteria of type $\beta$ (replacing $A$)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Each individual $B$ of type $\beta$ will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
<ul><li>spawn a new bacterium of type $\alpha$ (alongside $B$ who remains)</li>
<li>die</li>
</ul></li></ul><p>
If a population starts with a single bacterium of type $\alpha$, then it can be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the population will eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that the population will last forever. These probabilities are given rounded to 8 decimal places.
</p>
<p>
Now consider another species of bacteria, $S_{k,m}$ (where $k$ and $m$ are positive integers), which occurs in $k$ different types $\alpha_i$ for $0\le i&lt; k$. The rules governing this species' lifecycle involve the sequence $r_n$ defined by:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li>$r_0 = 306$</li>
<li>$r_{n+1} = r_n^2 \bmod 10\,007$</li>
</ul><p>
Every minute, for each $i$, each bacterium $A$ of type $\alpha_i$ will independently choose an integer $j$ uniformly at random in the range $0\le j&lt;m$. What it then does depends on $q = r_{im+j} \bmod 5$:</p>
<ul><li>If $q=0$, $A$ dies.</li>
<li>If $q=1$, $A$ clones itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type $\alpha_i$ (alongside $A$ who remains).</li>
<li>If $q=2$, $A$ mutates, changing into type $\alpha_{(2i) \bmod k}$.</li>
<li>If $q=3$, $A$ splits into 3 new bacteria of type $\alpha_{(i^2+1) \bmod k}$ (replacing $A$).</li>
<li>If $q=4$, $A$ spawns a new bacterium of type $\alpha_{(i+1) \bmod k}$ (alongside $A$ who remains).</li>
</ul><p>
In fact, our original species was none other than $S_{2,2}$, with $\alpha=\alpha_0$ and $\beta=\alpha_1$.
</p>
<p>
Let $P_{k,m}$ be the probability that a population of species $S_{k,m}$, starting with a single bacterium of type $\alpha_0$, will eventually die out. So $P_{2,2} = 0.07243802$. You are also given that $P_{4,3} = 0.18554021$ and $P_{10,5} = 0.53466253$, all rounded to 8 decimal places.

<p>Later, several new knights are appointed to the Order, giving $34$ knights and chairs in addition to the king's throne.

<li>if $n = 1$ do nothing and the process stops,</li>
<li>if $n$ is divisible by $7$ divide it by $7$,</li>
<li>otherwise add $1$.</li>

<h1>Problem 673</h1>
<p>At Euler University, each of the $n$ students (numbered from 1 to $n$) occupies a bed in the dormitory and uses a desk in the classroom.</p>

<p>Some of the beds are in private rooms which a student occupies alone, while the others are in double rooms occupied by two students as roommates. Similarly, each desk is either a single desk for the sole use of one student, or a twin desk at which two students sit together as desk partners.</p>

<p>We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of pairs of student numbers. For example, with $n=4$, if $(2,3)$ represents the bed pairing and $(1,3)(2,4)$ the desk pairing, then students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.</p>

<p>The new chancellor of the university decides to change the organisation of beds and desks: a permutation $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n$ will be chosen, and each student $k$ will be given both the bed and the desk formerly occupied by student number $\sigma(k)$.</p>

<p>The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any two students currently sharing a room will still be roommates.</li>
<li>Any two students currently sharing a desk will still be desk partners.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above, there are only two ways to satisfy these conditions: either take no action ($\sigma$ is the <strong>identity permutation</strong>), or reverse the order of the students.</p>

<p>With $n=6$, for the bed pairing $(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)$ and the desk pairing $(3,6)(4,5)$, there are 8 permutations which satisfy the conditions. One example is the mapping $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \mapsto (1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4)$.</p>

<p>With $n=36$, if we have bed pairing:<br>
$(2,13)(4,30)(5,27)(6,16)(10,18)(12,35)(14,19)(15,20)(17,26)(21,32)(22,33)(24,34)(25,28)$<br>
and desk pairing<br>
$(1,35)(2,22)(3,36)(4,28)(5,25)(7,18)(9,23)(13,19)(14,33)(15,34)(20,24)(26,29)(27,30)$<br>
then among the $36!$ possible permutations (including the identity permutation), 663552 of them satisfy the conditions stipulated by the students.</p>

<p>The downloadable text files <a href="resources/documents/0673_beds.txt">beds.txt</a> and <a href="resources/documents/0673_desks.txt">desks.txt</a> contain pairings for $n=500$. Each pairing is written on its own line, with the student numbers of the two roommates (or desk partners) separated with a comma. For example, the desk pairing in the $n=4$ example above would be represented in this file format as:</p>
<pre>
1,3
2,4
</pre>
<p>With these pairings, find the number of permutations that satisfy the students' conditions. Give your answer modulo $999\,999\,937$.</p>


<h1>Problem 674</h1>
<p>We define the $\mathcal{I}$ operator as the function
\[\mathcal{I}(x,y) = (1+x+y)^2+y-x\]
and $\mathcal{I}$-expressions as arithmetic expressions built only from variable names and applications of $\mathcal{I}$. A variable name may consist of one or more letters. For example, the three expressions $x$, $\mathcal{I}(x,y)$, and $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(x,ab),x)$ are all $\mathcal{I}$-expressions.</p>

<p>For two $\mathcal{I}$-expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$ such that the equation $e_1=e_2$ has a solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be the minimum value taken by $e_1$ and $e_2$ on such a solution. If the equation $e_1=e_2$ has no solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be $0$. For example, consider the following three $\mathcal{I}$-expressions:
\[\begin{array}{l}A = \mathcal{I}(x,\mathcal{I}(z,t))\\
B = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(y,z),y)\\
C = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(x,z),y)\end{array}\]
The least simultaneous value of $A$ and $B$ is $23$, attained for $x=3,y=1,z=t=0$. On the other hand, $A=C$ has no solutions in non-negative integers, so the least simultaneous value of $A$ and $C$ is $0$. The total sum of least simultaneous pairs made of $\mathcal{I}$-expressions from $\{A,B,C\}$ is $26$.</p>

<p>Find the sum of least simultaneous values of all $\mathcal{I}$-expressions pairs made of distinct expressions from file <a href="project/resources/p674_i_expressions.txt">I-expressions.txt</a> (pairs $(e_1,e_2)$ and $(e_2,e_1)$ are considered to be identical). Give the last nine digits of the result as the answer.</p>

<h1>Problem 683</h1>

The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire contents of the pot.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly selected player. A round then consists of a number of turns.</p>

<p>During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it. If a player rolls a 1 or a 2, the die is passed to the neighbour on the left; if the player rolls a 5 or a 6, the die is passed to the neighbour on the right; otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.</p>

<p>The round ends when one player has both dice at the beginning of a turn. At which point that player is immediately eliminated and has to pay $s^2$ where $s$ is the number of completed turns in this round. Note that if both dice happen to be handed to the same player at the beginning of a round, then no turns are completed, so the player is eliminated without having to pay any money into the pot.</p>

<p>
Originally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.<br>
Every morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is over.<br>
Every evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game continues like this.
</p>
<p>
Let us call a graph $G$ a <dfn>Tom graph</dfn>, if our super-smart Tom, who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location of Jerry, can <i>guarantee</i> to catch Jerry in finitely many days.

For graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because the game could potentially continue forever.

<p>The number of terms in this sequence is denoted $l(x,y)$.</p>

<h1>Problem 695</h1>

<h1>Problem 696</h1>
<p>The game of Mahjong is played with tiles belonging to $s$ <dfn>suits</dfn>. Each tile also has a <dfn>number</dfn> in the range $1\ldots n$, and for each suit/number combination there are exactly four indistinguishable tiles with that suit and number. (The real Mahjong game also contains other bonus tiles, but those will not feature in this problem.)</p>

<p>A <dfn>winning hand</dfn> is a collection of $3t+2$ Tiles (where $t$ is a fixed integer) that can be arranged as $t$ <dfn>Triples</dfn> and one <dfn>Pair</dfn>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <dfn>Triple</dfn> is either a <dfn>Chow</dfn> or a <dfn>Pung</dfn></li>
<li>A <dfn>Chow</dfn> is three tiles of the same suit and consecutive numbers</li>
<li>A <dfn>Pung</dfn> is three identical tiles (same suit and same number)</li>
<li>A <dfn>Pair</dfn> is two identical tiles (same suit and same number)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, here is a winning hand with $n=9$, $s=3$, $t=4$, consisting in this case of two Chows, two Pungs, and one Pair:</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0696_mahjong_1.png?1678992054" alt="A winning Mahjong hand">
</div>

<p>Note that sometimes the same collection of tiles can be represented as $t$ Triples and one Pair in more than one way. This only counts as one winning hand. For example, this is considered to be the same winning hand as above, because it consists of the same tiles:</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0696_mahjong_2.png?1678992054" alt="Alternative arrangement of the same hand">
</div>

<p>Let $w(n, s, t)$ be the number of distinct winning hands formed of $t$ Triples and one Pair, where there are $s$ suits available and tiles are numbered up to $n$.</p>

<p>For example, with a single suit and tiles numbered up to $4$, we have $w(4, 1, 1) = 20$: there are $12$ winning hands consisting of a Pung and a Pair, and another $8$ containing a Chow and a Pair. You are also given that $w(9, 1, 4) = 13259$, $w(9, 3, 4) = 5237550$, and $w(1000, 1000, 5) \equiv 107662178 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.</p>

<h1>Problem 698</h1>
<p>
We define <i>123-numbers</i> as follows:
</p>

<ul><li>1 is the smallest 123-number.</li>
<li>When written in base 10 the only digits that can be present are "1", "2" and "3" and if present the number of times they each occur is also a 123-number.</li>
</ul><p>
So 2 is a 123-number, since it consists of one  digit "2" and 1 is a 123-number. Therefore, 33 is a 123-number as well since it consists of two digits "3" and 2 is a 123-number.<br />
On the other hand, 1111 is not a 123-number, since it contains 4 digits "1" and 4 is not a 123-number.
</p>
<p>
In ascending order, the first 123-numbers are:<br />
$1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, 123, 131, \ldots$
</p>
<p>
Let $F(n)$ be the $n$-th 123-number. For example $F(4)=11$, $F(10)=31$, $F(40)=1112$, $F(1000)=1223321$ and $F(6000)= 2333333333323$.

<p>Consider the sequence 1504170715041707<var>n</var> mod 4503599627370517.</p>

<p>An element of this sequence is defined to be an Eulercoin if it is strictly smaller than all previously found Eulercoins.</p>

<p>For example, the first term is 1504170715041707 which is the first Eulercoin.  The second term is 3008341430083414 which is greater than 1504170715041707 so is not an Eulercoin.  However, the third term is 8912517754604 which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.</p>

<p>We shall define a <dfn>twopal</dfn> to be a palindromic tuple having at least one element with a value of 2. It should also be noted that elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13, 6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.</p>

<p>If we let $t(n)$ be the number of twopals whose elements sum to $n$, then it can be seen that $t(6) = 4$:</p>
$$(1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2)$$

<h1>Problem 716</h1>
<p>
Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of $H\times W$ nodes. 
The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.
$W$ vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, $H$ horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.
</p>
<p>
Two nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are <strong>strongly connected</strong> if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from $A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>strongly connected component</strong> in a directed graph is a non-empty set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes in $M$ are strongly connected to each other.</li>
<li>$M$ is maximal, in the sense that no node in $M$ is strongly connected to any node outside of $M$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are $2^H\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph $\mathcal{G}$. We define $S(\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in $\mathcal{G}$.
</p>
<p>
The illustration below shows a directed graph with $H=3$ and $W=4$ that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated by the different colours).

<h1>Problem 724</h1>
<p>A depot uses $n$ drones to disperse packages containing essential supplies along a long straight road.<br />
Initially all drones are stationary, loaded with a supply package.<br />
Every second, the depot selects a drone at random and sends it this instruction:</p>
<ul><li>If you are stationary, start moving at one centimetre per second along the road.</li>
<li>If you are moving, increase your speed by one centimetre per second along the road without changing direction.</li>
</ul><p>The road is wide enough that drones can overtake one another without risk of collision.</p>
<p>Eventually, there will only be one drone left at the depot waiting to receive its first instruction. As soon as that drone has flown one centimetre along the road, all drones drop their packages and return to the depot.</p>

<p>Let $E(n)$ be the expected distance in centimetres from the depot that the supply packages land.<br />

<h1>Problem 726</h1>
<p>
Consider a stack of bottles of wine. There are $n$ layers in the stack with the top layer containing only one bottle and the bottom layer containing $n$ bottles. For $n=4$ the stack looks like the picture below.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0726_FallingBottles.jpg?1678992055" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>
<p>
The <dfn>collapsing process</dfn> happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:
</p><ul>
<li>No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking $F$.</li>
<li>One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $D$.</li>
<li>Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $C$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle $A$ in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either $B$ or $C$. If it is filled with $C$ then the space that $C$ creates can be filled with $D$ or $E$. So there are 3 different collapsing processes that can happen if $A$ is taken, although the final shape (in this case) is the same.
</p>
<p>
Define $f(n)$ to be the number of ways that we can take all the bottles from a stack with $n$ layers. 
Two ways are considered different if at any step we took a different bottle or the collapsing process went differently.

You are given $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 6$ and $f(3) = 1008$.

For some starting values $a_0$ the sequence will be periodic. For example, $a_0=\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$ yields the sequence:

Take a sequence of length $n$. Discard the first term then make a sequence of the partial summations. Continue to do this over and over until we are left with a single term. We define this to be $f(n)$.
</p>
<p>
Consider the example where we start with a sequence of length 8:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
$
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\
 &amp;1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp; 6 &amp;7\\
 &amp; &amp;2&amp;5&amp;9&amp;14&amp;20&amp;27\\
 &amp; &amp; &amp;5&amp;14&amp;28&amp;48&amp;75\\
 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;14&amp;42&amp;90&amp;165\\
 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 42 &amp; 132 &amp; 297\\
 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; 132 &amp;429\\
 &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;429\\
\end{array}
$
</p>
<p>
Then the final number is $429$, so $f(8) = 429$.
</p>
<p>
For this problem we start with the sequence $1,3,4,7,11,18,29,47,\ldots$<br />
This is the Lucas sequence where two terms are added to get the next term.<br /> 
Applying the same process as above we get $f(8) = 2663$.<br />
You are also given $f(20) = 742296999 $ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$

<h1>Problem 740</h1>
<p>
Secret Santa is a process that allows $n$ people to give each other presents, so that each person gives a single present and receives a single present. At the beginning each of the $n$ people write their name on a slip of paper and put the slip into a hat. Each person takes a random slip from the hat. If the slip has their name they draw another random slip from the hat and then put the slip with their name back into the hat. At the end everyone buys a Christmas present for the person whose name is on the slip they are holding. This process will fail if the last person draws their own name.
</p>
<p>
In this variation each of the $n$ people gives and receives two presents. At the beginning each of the $n$ people writes their name on two slips of paper and puts the slips into a hat (there will be $2n$ slips of paper in the hat). As before each person takes from the hat a random slip that does not contain their own name. Then the same person repeats this process thus ending up with two slips, neither of which contains that person's own name. Then the next person draws two slips in the same way, and so on. The process will fail if the last person gets at least one slip with their own name.

By pouring water between the buckets exactly one litre of water can be measured.<br />
Since there is no other way to measure, once a pouring starts it cannot stop until either the source bucket is empty or the destination bucket is full.<br />
At least four pourings are needed to get one litre:

<h1>Problem 761</h1>
<p>Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along the pool edge.
While the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located anywhere at the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>We assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to $1$ in any direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to $v$ in either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their opponent.</p>

<p>Assuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge before the runner gets there, if $v$ is less than the critical speed $V_{Circle} \approx 4.60333885$ and can never win if $v&gt;V_{Circle}$.</p>

<p>Now the two players play the game in a perfectly square pool. Again the swimmer starts in the middle of the pool, while the runner starts at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool. It can be shown that the critical maximal speed of the runner below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer when trying to leave the pool is $V_{Square} \approx 5.78859314$.</p>

<p>At last, both players decide to play the game in a pool in the form of regular hexagon. Giving the same conditions as above, with the swimmer starting in the middle of the pool and the runner at the midpoint of one of the edges of the pool, find the critical maximal speed $V_{Hexagon}$ of the runner, below which the swimmer can always escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer.

<h1>Problem 765</h1>
<p>
Starting with 1 gram of gold you play a game. Each round you bet a certain amount of your gold: if you have $x$ grams you can bet $b$ grams for any $0 \le b \le x$. You then toss an unfair coin: with a probability of $0.6$ you double your bet (so you now have $x+b$), otherwise you lose your bet (so you now have $x-b$).
</p>
<p>
Choosing your bets to maximize your probability of having at least a trillion $(10^{12})$ grams of gold after $1000$ rounds, what is the probability that you become a trillionaire?

<p>For example, if $p = 5$, then there is a unique optimal pairing: $(1, 2), (3, 4)$, with total cost of $2 + 2 = 4$.</p>

<p>The <dfn>cost product</dfn> of a pairing is the product of the costs of its pairs. For example, the cost product of the optimal pairing for $p = 5$ is $2 \cdot 2 = 4$.</p>

<p>It turns out that all optimal pairings for $p = 2\,000\,000\,011$ have the same cost product.</p>

<h1>Problem 828</h1>

<ul>
<li>Each available number may be used at most once.</li>
<li>Only the four basic arithmetic operations are permitted: $+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$.</li>
<li>All intermediate values must be positive integers, so for example $(3\div 2)$ is never permitted as a subexpression (even if the final answer is an integer).</li>

<h1>Problem 837</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidakuji">Amidakuji</a> (Japanese: 阿弥陀籤) is a method for producing a random permutation of a set of objects.</p>

<p>
In the beginning, a number of parallel vertical lines are drawn, one for each object. Then a specified number of horizontal rungs are added, each lower than any previous rungs. Each rung is drawn as a line segment spanning a randomly select pair of adjacent vertical lines.</p>

<p>
For example, the following diagram depicts an Amidakuji with three objects ($A$, $B$, $C$) and six rungs:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="resources/images/0837_amidakuji.png?1678992054" alt="0837_amidakuji.png">
</div>

<p>
The coloured lines in the diagram illustrate how to form the permutation. For each object, starting from the top of its vertical line, trace downwards but follow any rung encountered along the way, and record which vertical we end up on. In this example, the resulting permutation happens to be the identity: $A\mapsto A$, $B\mapsto B$, $C\mapsto C$.</p>

<p>
Let $a(m, n)$ be the number of different three-object Amidakujis that have $m$ rungs between $A$ and $B$, and $n$ rungs between $B$ and $C$, and whose outcome is the identity permutation. For example, $a(3, 3) = 2$, because the Amidakuji shown above and its mirror image are the only ones with the required property.</p>

Define the <dfn>alternating shading</dfn> of a regular star polygon to be a selection of such regions to shade, such that every piece of every edge has a shaded region on one side and an unshaded region on the other, with the exterior of the polygon unshaded. For example, the above image shows the alternating shading (in green) of $\{8/3\}$.</p>

<p>Let $A(p, q)$ be the area of the alternating shading of $\{p/q\}$, assuming that its inradius is $1$. (The <strong>inradius</strong> of a regular polygon, star or otherwise, is the distance from its centre to the midpoint of any of its edges.) For example, in the diagram above, it can be shown that central shaded octagon has area $8(\sqrt{2}-1)$ and each point's shaded kite has area $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$, giving $A(8,3) = 24(\sqrt{2}-1) \approx 9.9411254970$.</p>

<p>You are also given that $A(130021, 50008)\approx 10.9210371479$, rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.</p>

<p>Find $\sum_{n=3}^{34} A(F_{n+1},F_{n-1})$, where $F_j$ is the Fibonacci sequence with $F_1=F_2=1$ (so $A(F_{5+1},F_{5-1}) = A(8,3)$). Give your answer rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.</p>


<h1>Problem 842</h1>
<p>
Given $n$ equally spaced points on a circle, we define an <dfn>$n$-star polygon</dfn> as an $n$-gon having those $n$ points as vertices. Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered <b>different</b>.</p>

<p>
For example, there are twelve $5$-star polygons shown below.</p>

For an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self intersection points.<br>
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.<br>
For the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$ self intersection points.</p>

Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines. These are only counted once. For example, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">$S$,</span> shown below is one of the sixty $6$-star polygons. This one has $I(S) = 4$.</p>

<h1>Problem 863</h1>
<p>Using only a six-sided fair dice and a five-sided fair dice, we would like to emulate an $n$-sided fair dice.</p>
<p>For example, one way to emulate a 28-sided dice is to follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll both dice, obtaining integers $1\le p\le 6$ and $1\le q\le 5$.</li>
<li>Combine them using $r = 5(p-1) + q$ to obtain an integer $1\le r\le 30$.</li>
<li>If $r\le 28$, return the value $r$ and stop.</li>
<li>Otherwise ($r$ being 29 or 30), roll both dice again, obtaining integers $1\le s\le 6$ and $1\le t\le 5$.</li>
<li>Compute $u = 30(r-29) + 5(s-1) + t$ to obtain an integer $1\le u\le 60$.</li>
<li>If $u&gt;4$, return the value $((u-5)\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.</li>
<li>Otherwise (with $1\le u\le 4$), roll the six-sided dice twice, obtaining integers $1\le v\le 6$ and $1\le w\le 6$.</li>
<li>Compute $x = 36(u-1) + 6(v-1) + w$ to obtain an integer $1\le x\le 144$.</li>
<li>If $x&gt;4$, return the value $((x-5)\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.</li>
<li>Otherwise (with $1\le x\le 4$), assign $u:=x$ and go back to step 7.</li>
</ol>

<p>The expected number of dice rolls in following this procedure is 2.142476 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Note that rolling both dice at the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.</p>

<p>There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows (D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,...), truncated wherever the process stops. In fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.</p>

<p>Different values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.</p>

<p>Define $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined. So, $R(8) \approx 2.083333$ and $R(28) \approx 2.142476$.</p>

As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together.</p>

<p>
Any time the father places a new piece in its correct position, a segment of length $k$ is formed and he writes down the $k$<sup>th</sup> hexagonal number $k\cdot(2k-1)$. Once all pieces have been placed and the full caterpillar constructed he calculates the product of all the numbers written down. Interestingly, the expected value of this product is always an integer. For example if $N=4$ then the expected value is $994$.</p>

<p>
Find the expected value of the product for a caterpillar of $N=100$ pieces.

There is a method that is used by Bell ringers to generate all variations of the order that bells are rung.</p>

<p>
The same method can be used to create all permutations of a set of letters. Consider the letters to be permuted initially in order from smallest to largest. At each step swap the largest letter with the letter on its left or right whichever generates a permutation that has not yet been seen. If neither gives a new permutation then try the next largest letter and so on. This procedure continues until all permutations have been generated.</p><p>

</p><p>
For example, $3$ swaps are required to reach the permutation CBA when starting with ABC.<br>
The swaps are ABC $\to$ ACB $\to$ CAB $\to$ CBA.<br>

<h1>Problem 879</h1>
<p>A touch-screen device can be unlocked with a "password" consisting of a sequence of two or more distinct spots that the user selects from a rectangular grid of spots on the screen. The user enters their sequence by touching the first spot, then tracing a straight line segment to the next spot, and so on until the end of the sequence. The user's finger remains in contact with the screen throughout, and may only move in straight line segments from spot to spot.</p>

<p>If the finger traces a straight line that passes over an intermediate spot, then that is treated as two line segments with the intermediate spot included in the password sequence. For example, on a $3\times 3$ grid labelled with digits $1$ to $9$ (shown below), tracing $1-9$ is interpreted as $1-5-9$.</p>

<p>Once a spot has been selected it disappears from the screen. Thereafter, the spot may not be used as an endpoint of future line segments, and it is ignored by any future line segments which happen to pass through it.

A round clock only has three hands: hour, minute, second. All hands look identical and move continuously. Moreover, there is no number or reference mark so that the "upright position" is unknown. The clock functions the same as a normal 12-hour analogue clock.</p>

<p>
Despite the inconvenient design, for most time it is possible to tell the correct time (within a 12-hour cycle) from the clock, just by measuring accurately the angles between the hands. For example, if all three hands coincide, then the time must be 12:00:00.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, there are several moments where the clock shows an ambiguous reading. For example, the following moment could be either 1:30:00 or 7:30:00 (with the clock rotated $180^\circ$). Thus both 1:30:00 and 7:30:00 are ambiguous moments.<br>
Note that even if two hands perfectly coincide, we can still see them as two distinct hands in the same position. Thus for example 3:00:00 and 9:00:00 are not ambiguous moments.

The upper three cuttings all have $d = 0$ because there are two black and two white pieces; the lower two cuttings both have $d = 2$ because there are three black and one white pieces.
Therefore $D(3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 4$. 
You are also given $D(100) \equiv 1172122931\pmod{1234567891}$.</p>

<h1>Problem 893</h1>
<p>
Define $M(n)$ to be the minimum number of matchsticks needed to represent the number $n$.</p>

<p>
A number can be represented in digit form or as an expression involving addition and/or multiplication. Also order of operations must be followed, that is multiplication binding tighter than addition. Any other symbols or operations, such as brackets, subtraction, division or exponentiation, are not allowed.</p>

<p>
The valid digits and symbols are shown below:</p>

<h1>Problem 895</h1>
<p>
Gary and Sally play a game using gold and silver coins arranged into a number of vertical stacks, alternating turns. On Gary's turn he chooses a gold coin and removes it from the game along with any other coins sitting on top. Sally does the same on her turn by removing a silver coin. The first player unable to make a move loses.</p>

<p>
An arrangement is called <dfn>fair</dfn> if the person moving first, whether it be Gary or Sally, will lose the game if both play optimally.</p>

<p>
An arrangement is called <dfn>balanced</dfn> if the number of gold and silver coins are equal.</p>

<p>
Define $G(m)$ to be the number of fair and balanced arrangements consisting of three non-empty stacks, each not exceeding $m$ in size. Different orderings of the stacks are to be counted separately, so $G(2)=6$ due to the following six arrangements:</p>

<h1>Problem 898</h1>
<p>
Claire Voyant is a teacher playing a game with a class of students.
A fair coin is tossed on the table. All the students can see the outcome of the toss, but Claire cannot.
Each student then tells Claire whether the outcome is head or tail. The students may lie, but Claire knows the probability that each individual student lies. Moreover, the students lie independently.
After that, Claire attempts to guess the outcome using an optimal strategy.
</p>
<p>
For example, for a class of four students with lying probabilities $20\%,40\%,60\%,80\%$, Claire guesses correctly with probability 0.832.
</p>

<h1>Problem 899</h1>
<p>
Two players play a game with two piles of stones. The players alternately take stones from one or both piles, subject to:</p>

<ol>
<li>the total number of stones taken is equal to the size of the smallest pile before the move;</li>

<li>the move cannot take all the stones from a pile.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The player that is unable to move loses.</p>

<p>
For example, if the piles are of sizes 3 and 5 then there are three possible moves.
$$(3,5) \xrightarrow{(2,1)} (1,4)\qquad\qquad (3,5) \xrightarrow{(1,2)} (2,3)\qquad\qquad (3,5) \xrightarrow{(0,3)} (3,2)$$</p>

<h1>Problem 901</h1>
<p>A driller drills for water. At each iteration the driller chooses a depth $d$ (a positive real number), drills to this depth and then checks if water was found. If so, the process terminates. Otherwise, a new depth is chosen and a new drilling starts from the ground level in a new location nearby.</p>

<p>Drilling to depth $d$ takes exactly $d$ hours. The groundwater depth is constant in the relevant area and its distribution is known to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential random variable</a> with expected value of $1$. In other words, the probability that the groundwater is deeper than $d$ is $e^{-d}$.</p>

<p>Assuming an optimal strategy, find the minimal expected drilling time in hours required to find water. Give your answer rounded to 9 places after the decimal point.</p>

<h1>Problem 902</h1>
<p>A permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ can be represented in <b>one-line notation</b> as $\pi(1),\ldots,\pi(n) $. If all $n!$ permutations are written in lexicographic order then $\textrm{rank}(\pi)$ is the position of $\pi$ in this 1-based list.</p>

<p>For example, $\text{rank}(2,1,3) = 3$ because the six permutations of $\{1, 2, 3\}$ in lexicographic order are:
$$1, 2, 3\quad 1, 3, 2 \quad 2, 1, 3 \quad 2, 3, 1 \quad 3, 1, 2 \quad 3, 2, 1$$
</p>

<p>For a positive integer $m$, we define the following permutation of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ with $n = \frac{m(m+1)}2$:
$$
\begin{align}
\sigma(i) &amp;= \begin{cases} \frac{k(k-1)}2 + 1 &amp; \textrm{if } i = \frac{k(k + 1)}2\textrm{ for }k\in\{1, \dots, m\};\\i + 1 &amp; \textrm{otherwise};\end{cases}\\
\tau(i) &amp;= ((10^9 + 7)i \bmod n) + 1\\
\pi(i) &amp;= \tau^{-1}(\sigma(\tau(i)))
\end{align}
$$

<p>Define $\displaystyle P(m) = \sum_{k=1}^{m!} \text{rank}(\pi^k)$.<br>
For example, $P(2) = 4$, $P(3) = 780$ and $P(4) = 38810300$.</p>
