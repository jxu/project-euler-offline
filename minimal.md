$3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples
is $23$.

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.

Problem 2
=========

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$
terms will be: $$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

made from the product of two $2$-digit numbers is $9009 = 91 \times
99$.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two $3$-digit
numbers.

Problem 5
=========

$2520$ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the
numbers from $1$ to $10$ without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is **evenly
divisible[divisible with no remainder]{.tooltiptext}** by all of the
numbers from $1$ to $20$?

Problem 6
=========

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$1^2 + 2^2 + \... + 10^2 = 385.$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

$$(1 + 2 + \... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Problem 7
=========

By listing the first six prime numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$, and $13$,

Problem 12
==========

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural
numbers. So the $7$^th^ triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 +
6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be: $$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28,
36, 45, 55, \dots$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

\begin{align} \mathbf 1 &\colon 1\\ \mathbf 3 &\colon 1,3\
\mathbf 6 &\colon 1,2,3,6\\ \mathbf{10} &\colon 1,2,5,10\
\mathbf{15} &\colon 1,3,5,15\\ \mathbf{21} &\colon 1,3,7,21\
\mathbf{28} &\colon 1,2,4,7,14,28 \end{align}

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five
divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
divisors?

Problem 14
==========

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive
integers:

-   $n \to n/2$ ($n$ is even)
-   $n \to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following
sequence: $$13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4
\to 2 \to 1.$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at
$1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet
(Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at
$1$.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one
million.

Problem 15
==========

Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only

Problem 16

$2^{15} = 32768$ and the sum of its digits is $3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 =
26$.

What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

Problem 17
==========

If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three,
four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in
total.

If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were
written out in words, how many letters would be used?



**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three
hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred
and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of \"and\" when writing
out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

Problem 18
==========

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent
numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is
$23$.

[**3**]{.red}
[**7**]{.red} 4
2 [**4**]{.red} 6

**NOTE:** As there are only $16384$ routes, it is possible to solve
this problem by trying every route. However, [Problem 67](problem=67),
is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it
cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

Problem 19
==========

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some
research for yourself.

-   1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
-   Thirty days has September,
    April, June and November.
    All the rest have thirty-one,
    Saving February alone,
    Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
    And on leap years, twenty-nine.
-   A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a
    century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth
century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Problem 20
==========

$n!$ means $n \times (n - 1) \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2
\times 1$.

For example, $10! = 10 \times 9 \times \cdots \times 3 \times 2
\times 1 = 3628800$,
and the sum of the digits in the number $10!$ is $3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 +
0 + 0 = 27$.

Find the sum of the digits in the number $100!$.

Problem 21
==========

Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers
less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$).
If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \ne b$, then $a$ and
$b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called
amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11,
20, 22, 44, 55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper
divisors of $284$ are $1, 2, 4, 71$ and $142$; so $d(284) =
220$.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.

Problem 22
==========

Using [names.txt](resources/documents/0022_names.txt) (right click and
\'Save Link/Target As\...\'), a 46K text file containing over
five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this
value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938$th name in
the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \times 53 = 49714$.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

Problem 23
==========

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors
of $28$ would be $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$, which means that $28$
is a perfect number.

A number $n$ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is
less than $n$ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$.

As $12$ is the smallest abundant number, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$,
the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant
numbers is $24$. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all
integers greater than $28123$ can be written as the sum of two
abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any
further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number
that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than
this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the
sum of two abundant numbers.

Problem 24
==========

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is
one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the
permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it
lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

Problem 25
==========

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> $F\_n = F\_{n - 1} + F\_{n - 2}$, where $F\_1 = 1$ and $F\_2 =
> 1$.

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

\begin{align} F\_1 &= 1\\ F\_2 &= 1\\ F\_3 &= 2\\ F\_4 &= 3\
F\_5 &= 5\\ F\_6 &= 8\\ F\_7 &= 13\\ F\_8 &= 21\\ F\_9 &= 34\
F\_{10} &= 55\\ F\_{11} &= 89\\ F\_{12} &= 144 \end{align}

The $12$th term, $F\_{12}$, is the first term to contain three
digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain
$1000$ digits?

Problem 26
==========

A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal
representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$
are given:

\begin{align} 1/2 &= 0.5\\ 1/3 &=0.(3)\\ 1/4 &=0.25\\ 1/5 &=
0.2\\ 1/6 &= 0.1(6)\\ 1/7 &= 0.(142857)\\ 1/8 &= 0.125\\ 1/9 &=
0.(1)\\ 1/10 &= 0.1 \end{align}

Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit
recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring
cycle.

Find the value of $d \lt 1000$ for which $1/d$ contains the longest
recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Problem 27
==========

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

$n^2 + n + 41$

It turns out that the formula will produce $40$ primes for the
consecutive integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40,
40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by $41$, and
certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by
$41$.

The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which
produces $80$ primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$.
The product of the coefficients, $-79$ and $1601$, is $-126479$.

Considering quadratics of the form:

> $n^2 + an + b$, where $\|a\| \< 1000$ and $\|b\| \le 1000$
> 
>
> <div>
>
> where $\|n\|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$
> e.g. $\|11\| = 11$ and $\|-4\| = 4$
>
> </div>

Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic
expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive
values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.

Problem 28

Starting with the number $1$ and moving to the right in a clockwise
direction a $5$ by $5$ spiral is formed as follows:

[**17**]{.red} 16 15 14 [**13**]{.red}

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is
$101$.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a $1001$ by
$1001$ spiral formed in the same way?

Problem 29
==========

Consider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 5$
and $2 \le b \le 5$:

\begin{matrix} 2^2=4, &2^3=8, &2^4=16, &2^5=32\\ 3^2=9,
&3^3=27, &3^4=81, &3^5=243\\ 4^2=16, &4^3=64, &4^4=256,
&4^5=1024\\ 5^2=25, &5^3=125, &5^4=625, &5^5=3125 \end{matrix}

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we
get the following sequence of $15$ distinct terms: $$4, 8, 9, 16,
25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125.$$

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $a^b$ for
$2 \le a \le 100$ and $2 \le b \le 100$?

Problem 30

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum
of fourth powers of their digits: \begin{align} 1634 &= 1^4 + 6^4 +
3^4 + 4^4\\ 8208 &= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4\\ 9474 &= 9^4 +
4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 \end{align}

As $1 = 1^4$ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is $1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316$.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence
(p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

> 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

Problem 32

We shall say that an $n$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of
all the digits $1$ to $n$ exactly once; for example, the $5$-digit
number, $15234$, is $1$ through $5$ pandigital.

The product $7254$ is unusual, as the identity, $39 \times 186 =
7254$, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is $1$
through $9$ pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
identity can be written as a $1$ through $9$ pandigital.

The fraction $49/98$ is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced
mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that
$49/98 = 4/8$, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the $9$s.

We shall consider fractions like, $30/50 = 3/5$, to be trivial
examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and
denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common
terms, find the value of the denominator.

$145$ is a curious number, as $1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial

Note: As $1! = 1$ and $2! = 2$ are not sums they are not included.

Problem 35

The number, $197$, is called a circular prime because all rotations of
the digits: $197$, $971$, and $719$, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below $100$: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,

palindromic in base $10$ and base $2$.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not
include leading zeros.)

Problem 37
==========

The number $3797$ has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it
is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain
prime at each stage: $3797$, $797$, $97$, and $7$. Similarly we
can work from right to left: $3797$, $379$, $37$, and $3$.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from

Take the number $192$ and multiply it by each of $1$, $2$, and
$3$:

\begin{align} 192 \times 1 &= 192\\ 192 \times 2 &= 384\\ 192
\times 3 &= 576 \end{align}

By concatenating each product we get the $1$ to $9$ pandigital,
$192384576$. We will call $192384576$ the concatenated product of
$192$ and $(1,2,3)$.

The same can be achieved by starting with $9$ and multiplying by
$1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$, giving the pandigital,
$918273645$, which is the concatenated product of $9$ and
$(1,2,3,4,5)$.

It can be seen that the $12$^th^ digit of the fractional part is

The $n$^th^ term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,

3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
example, the word value for SKY is $19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t\_{10}$. If
the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a
triangle word.

The number, $1406357289$, is a $0$ to $9$ pandigital number

property.

Let $d\_1$ be the $1$^st^ digit, $d\_2$ be the $2$^nd^ digit,

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number

The series, $1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + \cdots + 10^{10} = 10405071317$.

Find the last ten digits of the series, $1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + \cdots +
1000^{1000}$.

Problem 49
==========

The arithmetic sequence, $1487, 4817, 8147$, in which each of the
terms increases by $3330$, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the
three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the $4$-digit numbers are
permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three $1$-, $2$-, or
$3$-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other
$4$-digit increasing sequence.

What $12$-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in
this sequence?

Problem 50
==========

The prime $41$, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

$$41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.$$

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below
one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a
prime, contains $21$ terms, and is equal to $953$.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
consecutive primes?

Problem 51
==========

By replacing the 1^st^ digit of the 2-digit number \*3, it turns out
that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are
all prime.

By replacing the 3^rd^ and 4^th^ digits of 56\*\*3 with the same digit,
this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the
ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443,
56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of
this family, is the smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not
necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight
prime value family.

Problem 52
==========

It can be seen that the number, $125874$, and its double, $251748$,
contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, $x$, such that $2x$, $3x$,
$4x$, $5x$, and $6x$, contain the same digits.

Problem 53
==========

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 =
10$.

In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$,
where $r \le n$, $n! = n \times (n-1) \times \... \times 3
\times 2 \times 1$, and $0! = 1$.

It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million:
$\displaystyle \binom {23} {10} = 1144066$.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n
r$ for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?

Problem 54
==========

In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked,
from lowest to highest, in the following way:

-   **High Card**: Highest value card.
-   **One Pair**: Two cards of the same value.
-   **Two Pairs**: Two different pairs.
-   **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same value.
-   **Straight**: All cards are consecutive values.
-   **Flush**: All cards of the same suit.
-   **Full House**: Three of a kind and a pair.
-   **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same value.
-   **Straight Flush**: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
-   **Royal Flush**: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.

The cards are valued in the order:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives
(see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players
have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see
example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards
are compared, and so on.

Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

The file, [poker.txt](resources/documents/0054_poker.txt), contains
one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file
contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are
Player 1\'s cards and the last five are Player 2\'s cards. You can
assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated
cards), each player\'s hand is in no specific order, and in each hand
there is a clear winner.

How many hands does Player 1 win?

Problem 55
==========

If we take $47$, reverse and add, $47 + 74 = 121$, which is
palindromic.

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

\begin{align} 349 + 943 &= 1292\\ 1292 + 2921 &= 4213\\ 4213 + 3124
&= 7337 \end{align}

That is, $349$ took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.

Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like
$196$, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a
palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel
number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the
purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until
proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below
ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty
iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists,
has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, $10677$ is the
first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before
producing a palindrome: $4668731596684224866951378664$ ($53$
iterations, $28$-digits).

Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel
numbers; the first example is $4994$.

How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?

NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the
theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

Problem 56
==========

A googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by
one-hundred zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one
followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits
in each number is only $1$.

Considering natural numbers of the form, $a^b$, where $a, b \lt
100$, what is the maximum digital sum?

Problem 57
==========

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
an infinite continued fraction.

$\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

$1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac 32 = 1.5$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666
\dots$
$1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac
{41}{29} = 1.41379 \dots$

The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac
{239}{169}$, and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion,
$\frac {1393}{985}$, is the first example where the number of digits
in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a
numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Problem 58
==========

Starting with $1$ and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a
square spiral with side length $7$ is formed.

[**37**]{.red} 36 35 34 33 32 [**31**]{.red}
38 [**17**]{.red} 16 15 14 [**13**]{.red} 30
39 18 [ **5**]{.red}  4 [ **3**]{.red} 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20 [ **7**]{.red}  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
[**43**]{.red} 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom
right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that $8$ out of the
$13$ numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of
$8/13 \approx 62\%$.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
spiral with side length $9$ will be formed. If this process is
continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the
ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below $10\%$?

Problem 59
==========

Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred
standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).
For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (\*) = 42, and lowercase k =
107.

A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to
ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key.
The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption
key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42
= 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.

For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and
without both \"halves\", it is impossible to decrypt the message.

Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the
modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is
shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated
cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using
a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be
memorable.

Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three
lower case characters. Using
[0059\_cipher.txt](resources/documents/0059_cipher.txt) (right click and
\'Save Link/Target As\...\'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII
codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English
words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the
original text.

Problem 60
==========

The primes $3$, $7$, $109$, and $673$, are quite remarkable. By
taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result
will always be prime. For example, taking $7$ and $109$, both
$7109$ and $1097$ are prime. The sum of these four primes, $792$,
represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
concatenate to produce another prime.

Problem 61
==========

Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal
numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the
following formulae:

  ------------ --- ------------------------ --- ------------------------------
  Triangle         $P\_{3,n}=n(n+1)/2$        $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots$
  Square           $P\_{4,n}=n^2$            $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots$
  Pentagonal       $P\_{5,n}=n(3n-1)/2$       $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots$
  Hexagonal        $P\_{6,n}=n(2n-1)$         $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots$
  Heptagonal       $P\_{7,n}=n(5n-3)/2$       $1, 7, 18, 34, 55, \dots$
  Octagonal        $P\_{8,n}=n(3n-2)$         $1, 8, 21, 40, 65, \dots$
  ------------ --- ------------------------ --- ------------------------------

The ordered set of three $4$-digit numbers: $8128$, $2882$,
$8281$, has three interesting properties.

1.  The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the
    first two digits of the next number (including the last number with
    the first).
2.  Each polygonal type: triangle ($P\_{3,127}=8128$), square
    ($P\_{4,91}=8281$), and pentagonal ($P\_{5,44}=2882$), is
    represented by a different number in the set.
3.  This is the only set of $4$-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic $4$-digit numbers
for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal,
heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the
set.

Problem 62
==========

The cube, $41063625$ ($345^3$), can be permuted to produce two
other cubes: $56623104$ ($384^3$) and $66430125$ ($405^3$). In
fact, $41063625$ is the smallest cube which has exactly three
permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits
are cube.

Problem 63
==========

The $5$-digit number, $16807=7^5$, is also a fifth power.
Similarly, the $9$-digit number, $134217728=8^9$, is a ninth power.

How many $n$-digit positive integers exist which are also an $n$th
power?

Problem 64
==========

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and
can be written in the form:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a\_0+\frac 1 {a\_1+\frac 1
{a\_2+ \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$

For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1
{\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+
\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$

The process can be summarised as follows:

$\quad \quad a\_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4}
7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a\_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)}
{14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$
$\quad \quad a\_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)}
{14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a\_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)}
7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
$\quad \quad a\_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4}
7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a\_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7
(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$
$\quad \quad a\_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)}
{14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a\_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)}
{7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use
the notation $\sqrt{23}=\[4;(1,3,1,8)\]$, to indicate that the block
(1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square
roots are:

$\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=\[1;(2)\]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=\[1;(1,2)\]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=\[2;(4)\]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=\[2;(2,4)\]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=\[2;(1,1,1,4)\]$, period=$4$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=\[2;(1,4)\]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=\[3;(6)\]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=\[3;(3,6)\]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=\[3;(2,6)\]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=\[3;(1,1,1,1,6)\]$, period=$5$

Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period.

How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?

Problem 65
==========

The square root of $2$ can be written as an infinite continued
fraction.

$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 +
\dfrac{1}{2 + \...}}}}$

The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = \[1;
(2)\]$, $(2)$ indicates that $2$ repeats *ad infinitum*. In a
similar way, $\sqrt{23} = \[4; (1, 3, 1, 8)\]$.

It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions
for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us
consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.

$\begin{align} &1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\ &1 +
\dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\ &1 + \dfrac{1}{2 +
\dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\ &1 + \dfrac{1}{2 +
\dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29}
\end{align}$

Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:

$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29},
\dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408},
\dfrac{1393}{985}, \dfrac{3363}{2378}, \...$

What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
$e = \[2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, \... , 1, 2k, 1, \...\]$.

The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for $e$ are:

$2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32},
\dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465},
\dfrac{1457}{536}, \...$

The sum of digits in the numerator of the $10$^th^ convergent is $1 +
4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.

Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the $100$^th^ convergent of
the continued fraction for $e$.

Problem 66
==========

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form: $$x^2 - Dy^2 =
1$$

For example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is $649^2 -
13 \times 180^2 = 1$.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when
$D$ is square.

By finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = \{2, 3, 5, 6, 7\}$,
we obtain the following:

\begin{align} 3^2 - 2 \times 2^2 &= 1\\ 2^2 - 3 \times 1^2 &=
1\\ {\color{red}{\mathbf 9}}^2 - 5 \times 4^2 &= 1\\ 5^2 - 6
\times 2^2 &= 1\\ 8^2 - 7 \times 3^2 &= 1 \end{align}

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D \le 7$, the
largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.

Find the value of $D \le 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for
which the largest value of $x$ is obtained.

Problem 70
==========

Euler\'s totient function, $\phi(n)$ \[sometimes called the phi

than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example,
as $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$, and $8$, are all less than nine and relatively
prime to nine, $\phi(9)=6$.
The number $1$ is considered to be relatively prime to every positive
number, so $\phi(1)=1$.

Interestingly, $\phi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$
is a permutation of $79180$.

Consider the fraction, $\dfrac n d$, where $n$ and $d$ are
positive integers. If $n \lt d$ and $\operatorname{HCF}(n,d)=1$,
it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \le 8$ in
ascending order of size, we get: $$\frac 1 8, \frac 1 7, \frac 1 6,
\frac 1 5, \frac 1 4, \frac 2 7, \frac 1 3, \frac 3 8,

\frac 5 8, \frac 2 3, \frac 5 7, \frac 3 4, \frac 4 5, \frac 5 6,
\frac 6 7, \frac 7 8$$

It can be seen that $\dfrac 2 5$ is the fraction immediately to the
left of $\dfrac 3 7$.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \le

Problem 74

The number $145$ is well known for the property that the sum of the
factorial of its digits is equal to $145$: $$1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 +
120 = 145.$$

Perhaps less well known is $169$, in that it produces the longest
chain of numbers that link back to $169$; it turns out that there are
only three such loops that exist:

\begin{align} &169 \to 363601 \to 1454 \to 169\\ &871 \to 45361
\to 871\\ &872 \to 45362 \to 872 \end{align}

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually
get stuck in a loop. For example,

\begin{align} &69 \to 363600 \to 1454 \to 169 \to 363601 (\to
1454)\\ &78 \to 45360 \to 871 \to 45361 (\to 871)\\ &540 \to
145 (\to 145) \end{align}

Starting with $69$ produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but
the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million
is sixty terms.

How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain
exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

It turns out that $\pu{12 cm}$ is the smallest length of wire that

way, but there are many more examples.

-   $\pu{\mathbf{24} \mathbf{cm}}$: $(6,8,10)$

-   $\pu{\mathbf{40} \mathbf{cm}}$: $(8,15,17)$
-   $\pu{\mathbf{48} \mathbf{cm}}$: $(12,16,20)$

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like $\pu{20 cm}$, cannot be bent
to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow
more than one solution to be found; for example, using $\pu{120 cm}$
it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle
triangles.

-   $\pu{\mathbf{120} \mathbf{cm}}$: $(30,40,50)$,
    $(20,48,52)$, $(24,45,51)$

In the game, **Monopoly**, the standard board is set up in the following
way:

::: {.center}
![0084\_monopoly\_board.png](resources/images/0084_monopoly_board.png?1678992052)
:::

A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice
to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise
direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each
square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To
Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.

In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the
player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive
doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they
proceed directly to jail.

At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a
player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective
pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom
of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose
of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement;
any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the
player will remain on the CC/CH square.

-   Community Chest (2/16 cards):
    1.  Advance to GO
    2.  Go to JAIL
-   Chance (10/16 cards):
    1.  Advance to GO
    2.  Go to JAIL
    3.  Go to C1
    4.  Go to E3
    5.  Go to H2
    6.  Go to R1
    7.  Go to next R (railway company)
    8.  Go to next R
    9.  Go to next U (utility company)
    10. Go back 3 squares.

The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a
particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square
after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the
exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero,
the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a
movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player
finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no
distinction between \"Just Visiting\" and being sent to JAIL, and we
shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to \"get out of
jail\", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.

By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39
we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that
correspond with sets of squares.

Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in
order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO
(3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed
with the six-digit modal string: 102400.

If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find
the six-digit modal string.

It can be shown that there are exactly $2060$ distinct cuboids,
ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of
$M$ by $M$ by $M$, for which the shortest route has integer length
when $M = 100$. This is the least value of $M$ for which the number
of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions when
$M = 99$ is $1975$.

Find the least value of $M$ such that the number of solutions first
exceeds one million.

Problem 87
==========

The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime
cube, and prime fourth power is $28$. In fact, there are exactly four
numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:

\begin{align} 28 &= 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\ 33 &= 3^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\
49 &= 5^2 + 2^3 + 2^4\\ 47 &= 2^2 + 3^3 + 2^4 \end{align}

How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a
prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?

Problem 88
==========

A natural number, $N$, that can be written as the sum and product of a
given set of at least two natural numbers, $\{a\_1, a\_2, \dots,
a\_k\}$ is called a product-sum number: $N = a\_1 + a\_2 + \cdots +
a\_k = a\_1 \times a\_2 \times \cdots \times a\_k$.

For example, $6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 \times 2 \times 3$.

For a given set of size, $k$, we shall call the smallest $N$ with
this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum
numbers for sets of size, $k = 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$ are as follows.

-   $k=2$: $4 = 2 \times 2 = 2 + 2$
-   $k=3$: $6 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 1 + 2 + 3$
-   $k=4$: $8 = 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4$
-   $k=5$: $8 = 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 1 + 1 +
    2 + 2 + 2$
-   $k=6$: $12 = 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 6
    = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6$

Hence for $2 \le k \le 6$, the sum of all the minimal product-sum
numbers is $4+6+8+12 = 30$; note that $8$ is only counted once in
the sum.

In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for $2 \le
k \le 12$ is $\{4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16\}$, the sum is $61$.

What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for $2 \le k
\le 12000$?

Problem 89
==========

For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are
basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some
numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a \"best\"
way of writing a particular number.

For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing
the number sixteen:

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI

However, according to the rules only [XIIIIII]{.monospace} and
[XVI]{.monospace} are valid, and the last example is considered to be
the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.

The 11K text file, [roman.txt](resources/documents/0089_roman.txt)
(right click and \'Save Link/Target As\...\'), contains one thousand
numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals;
see [About\... Roman Numerals](about=roman_numerals) for the definitive
rules for this problem.

Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their
minimal form.

Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no
more than four consecutive identical units.

Problem 90
==========

Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit ($0$ to $9$)
written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two
cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of
$2$-digit numbers.

For example, the square number $64$ could be formed:

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0090.png?1678992052){.dark_img}
:::

In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible
to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: $01$, $04$,
$09$, $16$, $25$, $36$, $49$, $64$, and $81$.

For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing $\{0, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9\}$ on one cube and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9\}$ on the other cube.

However, for this problem we shall allow the $6$ or $9$ to be turned
upside-down so that an arrangement like $\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$ and
$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\}$ allows for all nine square numbers to be
displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain $09$.

In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on
each cube, not the order.

-   $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ is equivalent to $\{3, 6, 4, 1, 2,
    5\}$
-   $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ is distinct from $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    9\}$

But because we are allowing $6$ and $9$ to be reversed, the two
distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set
$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9\}$ for the purpose of forming $2$-digit
numbers.

How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the
square numbers to be displayed?

Problem 91
==========

The points $P(x\_1, y\_1)$ and $Q(x\_2, y\_2)$ are plotted at
integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, $O(0,0)$, to form
$\triangle OPQ$.

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0091_1.png?1678992052){.dark_img}
:::

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can
be formed when each co-ordinate lies between $0$ and $2$ inclusive;
that is, $0 \le x\_1, y\_1, x\_2, y\_2 \le 2$.

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0091_2.png?1678992052)
:::

Given that $0 \le x\_1, y\_1, x\_2, y\_2 \le 50$, how many right
triangles can be formed?

Problem 92
==========

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the
digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example, \begin{align} &44 \to 32 \to 13 \to 10 \to \mathbf 1
\to \mathbf 1\\ &85 \to \mathbf{89} \to 145 \to 42 \to 20 \to
4 \to 16 \to 37 \to 58 \to \mathbf{89} \end{align}

Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in
an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will
eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?

Problem 93
==========

By using each of the digits from the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, exactly
once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations ($+, -, \times,
/$) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive
integer targets.

For example,

\begin{align} 8 &= (4 \times (1 + 3)) / 2\\ 14 &= 4 \times (3 + 1 /
2)\\ 19 &= 4 \times (2 + 3) - 1\\ 36 &= 3 \times 4 \times (2 + 1)
\end{align}

Note that concatenations of the digits, like $12 + 34$, are not
allowed.

Using the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, it is possible to obtain thirty-one
different target numbers of which $36$ is the maximum, and each of the
numbers $1$ to $28$ can be obtained before encountering the first
non-expressible number.

Find the set of four distinct digits, $a \lt b \lt c \lt d$, for
which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, $1$ to $n$,
can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: *abcd*.

Problem 94
==========

It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral
length sides and integral area. However, the [almost equilateral
triangle]{.dfn} $5$-$5$-$6$ has an area of $12$ square units.

We shall define an [almost equilateral triangle]{.dfn} to be a triangle
for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one
unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all [almost equilateral
triangles]{.dfn} with integral side lengths and area and whose
perimeters do not exceed one billion ($1\,000\,000\,000$).

Problem 95
==========

The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the
number itself. For example, the proper divisors of $28$ are $1$,
$2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$. As the sum of these divisors is equal
to $28$, we call it a perfect number.

Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $284$ and
the sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is $220$, forming a chain of
two numbers. For this reason, $220$ and $284$ are called an amicable
pair.

Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with
$12496$, we form a chain of five numbers: $$12496 \to 14288 \to
15472 \to 14536 \to 14264 (\to 12496 \to \cdots)$$

Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable
chain.

Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element
exceeding one million.

Problem 96
==========

Su Doku (Japanese meaning *number place*) is the name given to a popular
puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to
Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle
idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is
to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row,
column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an
example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

:::

A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be
solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ \"guess and
test\" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested
opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the
difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered *easy* because
it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.

The 6K text file, [sudoku.txt](project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt) (right

puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first

in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the
3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.

Problem 97
==========

The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered
in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593} - 1$; it
contains exactly $2\,098\,960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne
primes, of the form $2^p - 1$, have been found which contain more
digits.

However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which
contains $2\,357\,207$ digits: $28433 \times 2^{7830457} + 1$.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

Problem 98
==========

By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with $1$, $2$,
$9$, and $6$ respectively, we form a square number: $1296 =
36^2$. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital
substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: $9216 =
96^2$. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and
specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a
different letter have the same digital value as another letter.

Using [words.txt](resources/documents/0098_words.txt) (right click and

What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?

NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.

Problem 99
==========

Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and
$3^7$ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that
$2^{11} = 2048 \lt 3^7 = 2187$.

However, confirming that $632382^{518061} \gt 519432^{525806}$
would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million
digits.

Problem 100
===========

If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue
discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be
seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, $P(\text{BB}) =
(15/21) \times (14/20) = 1/2$.

The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly $50\%$ chance
of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue
discs and thirty-five red discs.

By finding the first arrangement to contain over $10^{12} =
1\,000\,000\,000\,000$ discs in total, determine the number of blue
discs that the box would contain.

Problem 101
===========

If we are presented with the first $k$ terms of a sequence it is
impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there
are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.

As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is
defined by the generating function,
$u\_n = n^3$: $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \dots$

Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working
on the principle that \"simple is best\" we should assume a linear
relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference
$7$). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the
same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be
assumed.

We shall define $\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ to be the $n$^th^ term of
the optimum polynomial generating function for the first $k$ terms of
a sequence. It should be clear that $\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will
accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \le k$, and
potentially the [first incorrect term]{.dfn} (FIT) will be
$\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a [bad
OP]{.dfn} (BOP).

As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would
be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n \ge 2$,
$\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = u\_1$.

Hence we obtain the following $\operatorname{OP}$s for the cubic
sequence:

::: {.margin_left}
  ----------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  $\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = 1$                      $1, {\color{red}\mathbf 1}, 1, 1, \dots$
  $\operatorname{OP}(2, n) = 7n - 6$                 $1, 8, {\color{red}\mathbf{15}}, \dots$
  $\operatorname{OP}(3, n) = 6n^2 - 11n + 6$        $1, 8, 27, {\color{red}\mathbf{58}}, \dots$
  $\operatorname{OP}(4, n) = n^3$                   $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, \dots$
  ----------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------
:::

Clearly no BOPs exist for $k \ge 4$.

By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in
[**red**]{.red} above), we obtain $1 + 15 + 58 = 74$.

Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:
$$u\_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + n^4 - n^5 + n^6 - n^7 + n^8 - n^9
+ n^{10}.$$

Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.

Problem 102
===========

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for
which $-1000 \le x, y \le 1000$, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

\begin{gather} A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)\\ X(-175,41),
Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645) \end{gather}

It can be verified that triangle $ABC$ contains the origin, whereas
triangle $XYZ$ does not.

Using [triangles.txt](resources/documents/0102_triangles.txt) (right
click and \'Save Link/Target As\...\'), a 27K text file containing the
co-ordinates of one thousand \"random\" triangles, find the number of
triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the
example given above.

Problem 103
===========

Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$.
We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint
subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:

1.  $S(B) \ne S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2.  If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) \gt S(C)$.

If $S(A)$ is minimised for a given $n$, we shall call it an optimum
special sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given
below.

-   $n = 1$: $\{1\}$
-   $n = 2$: $\{1, 2\}$
-   $n = 3$: $\{2, 3, 4\}$
-   $n = 4$: $\{3, 5, 6, 7\}$
-   $n = 5$: $\{6, 9, 11, 12, 13\}$

It *seems* that for a given optimum set, $A = \{a\_1, a\_2, \dots,
a\_n\}$, the next optimum set is of the form $B = \{b, a\_1 + b,
a\_2 + b, \dots, a\_n + b\}$, where $b$ is the \"middle\" element
on the previous row.

By applying this \"rule\" we would expect the optimum set for $n = 6$
to be $A = \{11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24\}$, with $S(A) = 117$.
However, this is not the optimum set, as we have merely applied an
algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The optimum set for $n = 6$
is $A = \{11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25\}$, with $S(A) = 115$ and
corresponding set string: 111819202225.

Given that $A$ is an optimum special sum set for $n = 7$, find its
set string.

NOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 105](problem=105) and [Problem
106](problem=106).

Problem 104
===========

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> $F\_n = F\_{n - 1} + F\_{n - 2}$, where $F\_1 = 1$ and $F\_2 =
> 1$.

It turns out that $F\_{541}$, which contains $113$ digits, is the
first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are $1$-$9$
pandigital (contain all the digits $1$ to $9$, but not necessarily
in order). And $F\_{2749}$, which contains $575$ digits, is the
first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are $1$-$9$
pandigital.

Given that $F\_k$ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first
nine digits AND the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital, find
$k$.

Problem 105
===========

Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$.
We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint
subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:

1.  $S(B) \ne S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2.  If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) \gt S(C)$.

For example, $\{81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65\}$ is not a special
sum set because $65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84$, whereas $\{157, 150,
164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139, 158\}$ satisfies both rules for all
possible subset pair combinations and $S(A) = 1286$.

Using [sets.txt](resources/documents/0105_sets.txt) (right click and
\"Save Link/Target As\...\"), a 4K text file with one-hundred sets
containing seven to twelve elements (the two examples given above are
the first two sets in the file), identify all the special sum sets,
$A\_1, A\_2, \dots, A\_k$, and find the value of $S(A\_1) + S(A\_2)
+ \cdots + S(A\_k)$.

NOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 103](problem=103) and [Problem
106](problem=106).

Problem 106
===========

Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$.
We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint
subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:

1.  $S(B) \ne S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2.  If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) \gt S(C)$.

For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains $n$
strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the $25$ possible subset pairs that can be
obtained from a set for which $n = 4$, only $1$ of these pairs need
to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when $n = 7$, only
$70$ out of the $966$ subset pairs need to be tested.

For $n = 12$, how many of the $261625$ subset pairs that can be
obtained need to be tested for equality?

Problem 108
===========

In the following equation $x$, $y$, and $n$ are positive integers.

$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$

For $n = 4$ there are exactly three distinct solutions:

$$\begin{align} \dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{20} &= \dfrac{1}{4}\
\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{12} &= \dfrac{1}{4}\\ \dfrac{1}{8} +

What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct
solutions exceeds one-thousand?

it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.

Problem 109
===========

In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which
is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.

::: {.center}
![](project/images/p109.png){.dark_img}
:::

The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the
dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores
zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single
scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double
and treble scores respectively.

At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull
region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner
bull is a double, worth 50 points.

There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the
players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to
reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to
play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a
double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on
their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running
total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is
\"bust\".

When a player is able to finish on their current score it is called a
\"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble
20s and double bull).

There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:

  ------- ------- -------
                       
  D3              
  D1      D2

:::

Note that D1 D2 is considered **different** to D2 D1 as they finish on
different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the
**same** as T1 S1 D1.

In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for
example, D3 is the **same** as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.

Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.

How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

Problem 110
===========

In the following equation $x$, $y$, and $n$ are positive integers.

$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$

It can be verified that when $n = 1260$ there are $113$ distinct
solutions and this is the least value of $n$ for which the total
number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct
solutions exceeds four million?

NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of [Problem
108](problem=108) and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute
force approach it requires a clever implementation.

Problem 111
===========

Considering $4$-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear
that they cannot all be the same: $1111$ is divisible by $11$,
$2222$ is divisible by $22$, and so on. But there are nine
$4$-digit primes containing three ones: $$1117, 1151, 1171, 1181,
1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111.$$

We shall say that $M(n, d)$ represents the maximum number of repeated
digits for an $n$-digit prime where $d$ is the repeated digit,
$N(n, d)$ represents the number of such primes, and $S(n, d)$
represents the sum of these primes.

So $M(4, 1) = 3$ is the maximum number of repeated digits for a
$4$-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are $N(4, 1) =
9$ such primes, and the sum of these primes is $S(4, 1) = 22275$. It
turns out that for $d = 0$, it is only possible to have $M(4, 0) =
2$ repeated digits, but there are $N(4, 0) = 13$ such cases.

In the same way we obtain the following results for $4$-digit primes.

For $d = 0$ to $9$, the sum of all $S(4, d)$ is $273700$.

Find the sum of all $S(10, d)$.

Problem 112
===========

Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
left it is called an increasing number; for example, $134468$.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called
a decreasing number; for example, $66420$.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor
decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, $155349$.

Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
over half of the numbers below one-thousand ($525$) are bouncy. In
fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first
reaches $50\%$ is $538$.

Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time
we reach $21780$ the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to
$90\%$.

Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is
exactly $99\%$.

Problem 113
===========

Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its
left it is called an increasing number; for example, $134468$.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called
a decreasing number; for example, $66420$.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor
decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, $155349$.

As $n$ increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below $n$
increases such that there are only $12951$ numbers below one-million
that are not bouncy and only $277032$ non-bouncy numbers below
$10^{10}$.

How many numbers below a googol ($10^{100}$) are not bouncy?

Problem 114
===========

A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum
length of three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which
are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one grey
square. There are exactly seventeen ways of doing this.

::: {.center}
![0114.png](resources/images/0114.png?1678992052)
:::

How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?

NOTE: Although the example above does not lend itself to the
possibility, in general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example,
on a row measuring eight units in length you could use red (3), grey
(1), and red (4).

Problem 115
===========

NOTE: This is a more difficult version of [Problem 114](problem=114).

A row measuring $n$ units in length has red blocks with a minimum
length of $m$ units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which
are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black
square.

Let the fill-count function, $F(m, n)$, represent the number of ways
that a row can be filled.

For example, $F(3, 29) = 673135$ and $F(3, 30) = 1089155$.

That is, for $m = 3$, it can be seen that $n = 30$ is the smallest
value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

In the same way, for $m = 10$, it can be verified that $F(10, 56) =
880711$ and $F(10, 57) = 1148904$, so $n = 57$ is the least value
for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

For $m = 50$, find the least value of $n$ for which the fill-count
function first exceeds one million.

Problem 116
===========

A row of five grey square tiles is to have a number of its tiles
replaced with coloured oblong tiles chosen from red (length two), green
(length three), or blue (length four).

If red tiles are chosen there are exactly seven ways this can be done.

Assuming that colours cannot be mixed there are $7 + 3 + 2 = 12$ ways
of replacing the grey tiles in a row measuring five units in length.

How many different ways can the grey tiles in a row measuring fifty
units in length be replaced if colours cannot be mixed and at least one
coloured tile must be used?

NOTE: This is related to [Problem 117](problem=117).

Problem 117
===========

Using a combination of grey square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from:
red tiles (measuring two units), green tiles (measuring three units),
and blue tiles (measuring four units), it is possible to tile a row
measuring five units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.

Problem 118
===========

Using all of the digits $1$ through $9$ and concatenating them
freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed.
Interestingly with the set $\{2,5,47,89,631\}$, all of the elements
belonging to it are prime.

How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine
exactly once contain only prime elements?

Problem 119
===========

The number $512$ is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its
digits raised to some power: $5 + 1 + 2 = 8$, and $8^3 = 512$.
Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$.

We shall define $a\_n$ to be the $n$th term of this sequence and
insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that $a\_2 = 512$ and $a\_{10} = 614656$.

Find $a\_{30}$.

Problem 120
===========

Let $r$ be the remainder when $(a - 1)^n + (a + 1)^n$ is divided
by $a^2$.

For example, if $a = 7$ and $n = 3$, then $r = 42$: $6^3 + 8^3
= 728 \equiv 42 \mod 49$. And as $n$ varies, so too will $r$, but
for $a = 7$ it turns out that $r\_{\mathrm{max}} = 42$.

For $3 \le a \le 1000$, find $\sum r\_{\mathrm{max}}$.

Problem 121
===========

A bag contains one red disc and one blue disc. In a game of chance a
player takes a disc at random and its colour is noted. After each turn
the disc is returned to the bag, an extra red disc is added, and another
disc is taken at random.

The player pays £1 to play and wins if they have taken more blue discs
than red discs at the end of the game.

If the game is played for four turns, the probability of a player
winning is exactly 11/120, and so the maximum prize fund the banker
should allocate for winning in this game would be £10 before they would
expect to incur a loss. Note that any payout will be a whole number of
pounds and also includes the original £1 paid to play the game, so in
the example given the player actually wins £9.

Find the maximum prize fund that should be allocated to a single game in
which fifteen turns are played.

Problem 122
===========

The most naive way of computing $n^{15}$ requires fourteen
multiplications: $$n \times n \times \cdots \times n =
n^{15}.$$

But using a \"binary\" method you can compute it in six multiplications:

\begin{align} n \times n &= n^2\\ n^2 \times n^2 &= n^4\
n^4 \times n^4 &= n^8\\ n^8 \times n^4 &= n^{12}\\ n^{12}
\times n^2 &= n^{14}\\ n^{14} \times n &= n^{15} \end{align}

However it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:

\begin{align} n \times n &= n^2\\ n^2 \times n &= n^3\\ n^3
\times n^3 &= n^6\\ n^6 \times n^6 &= n^{12}\\ n^{12}
\times n^3 &= n^{15} \end{align}

We shall define $m(k)$ to be the minimum number of multiplications to
compute $n^k$; for example $m(15) = 5$.

Find $\sum\limits\_{k = 1}^{200} m(k)$.

Problem 123
===========

Let $p\_n$ be the $n$th prime: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots$, and let
$r$ be the remainder when $(p\_n - 1)^n + (p\_n + 1)^n$ is divided
by $p\_n^2$.

For example, when $n = 3$, $p\_3 = 5$, and $4^3 + 6^3 = 280
\equiv 5 \mod 25$.

The least value of $n$ for which the remainder first exceeds $10^9$
is $7037$.

Find the least value of $n$ for which the remainder first exceeds
$10^{10}$.

Problem 124
===========

The radical of $n$, $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of the
distinct prime factors of $n$. For example, $504 = 2^3 \times 3^2
\times 7$, so $\operatorname{rad}(504) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 =
42$.

If we calculate $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 10$,
then sort them on $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, and sorting on $n$ if
the radical values are equal, we get:

Unsorted

If $\operatorname{rad}(n)$ is sorted for $1 \le n \le 100000$,
find $E(10000)$.

Problem 125
===========

The palindromic number $595$ is interesting because it can be written
as the sum of consecutive squares: $6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 +
11^2 + 12^2$.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be
written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is
$4164$. Note that $1 = 0^2 + 1^2$ has not been included as this
problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Find the sum of all the numbers less than $10^8$ that are both
palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.

Problem 126
===========

The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid
measuring $3 \times 2 \times 1$ is twenty-two.

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0126.png?1678992052){.dark_img}
:::

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six
cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require
seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and
eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.

However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring $5 \times 1 \times 1$
also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids
measuring $5 \times 3 \times 1$, $7 \times 2 \times 1$, and $11
\times 1 \times 1$ all contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define $C(n)$ to represent the number of cuboids that contain
$n$ cubes in one of its layers. So $C(22) = 2$, $C(46) = 4$,
$C(78) = 5$, and $C(118) = 8$.

It turns out that $154$ is the least value of $n$ for which $C(n) =
10$.

Find the least value of $n$ for which $C(n) = 1000$.

Problem 127
===========

The radical of $n$, $\operatorname{rad}(n)$, is the product of
distinct prime factors of $n$. For example, $504 = 2^3 \times 3^2
\times 7$, so $\operatorname{rad}(504) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 =
42$.

We shall define the triplet of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ to be an
abc-hit if:

1.  $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a, c) = \gcd(b, c) = 1$
2.  $a \lt b$
3.  $a + b = c$
4.  $\operatorname{rad}(abc) \lt c$

For example, $(5, 27, 32)$ is an abc-hit, because:

1.  $\gcd(5, 27) = \gcd(5, 32) = \gcd(27, 32) = 1$
2.  $5 \lt 27$
3.  $5 + 27 = 32$
4.  $\operatorname{rad}(4320) = 30 \lt 32$

It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one
abc-hits for $c \lt 1000$, with $\sum c = 12523$.

Find $\sum c$ for $c \lt 120000$.

Problem 128
===========

A hexagonal tile with number $1$ is surrounded by a ring of six
hexagonal tiles, starting at \"12 o\'clock\" and numbering the tiles
$2$ to $7$ in an anti-clockwise direction.

New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being
numbered $8$ to $19$, $20$ to $37$, $38$ to $61$, and so on.
The diagram below shows the first three rings.

By finding the difference between tile $n$ and each of its six
neighbours we shall define $\operatorname{PD}(n)$ to be the number of
those differences which are prime.

For example, working clockwise around tile $8$ the differences are
$12, 29, 11, 6, 1$, and $13$. So $\operatorname{PD}(8) = 3$.

In the same way, the differences around tile $17$ are $1, 17, 16, 1,
11$, and $10$, hence $\operatorname{PD}(17) = 2$.

It can be shown that the maximum value of $\operatorname{PD}(n)$ is
$3$.

If all of the tiles for which $\operatorname{PD}(n) = 3$ are listed
in ascending order to form a sequence, the $10$th tile would be
$271$.

Find the $2000$th tile in this sequence.

Problem 129
===========

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall
define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) =
111111$.

Given that $n$ is a positive integer and $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$, it can
be shown that there always exists a value, $k$, for which $R(k)$ is
divisible by $n$, and let $A(n)$ be the least such value of $k$;
for example, $A(7) = 6$ and $A(41) = 5$.

The least value of $n$ for which $A(n)$ first exceeds ten is $17$.

Find the least value of $n$ for which $A(n)$ first exceeds
one-million.

Problem 130
===========

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall
define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) =
111111$.

Given that $n$ is a positive integer and $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$, it can
be shown that there always exists a value, $k$, for which $R(k)$ is
divisible by $n$, and let $A(n)$ be the least such value of $k$;
for example, $A(7) = 6$ and $A(41) = 5$.

You are given that for all primes, $p \gt 5$, that $p - 1$ is
divisible by $A(p)$. For example, when $p = 41$, $A(41) = 5$, and
$40$ is divisible by $5$.

However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true;
the first five examples being $91$, $259$, $451$, $481$, and
$703$.

Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of $n$ for
which $\gcd(n, 10) = 1$ and $n - 1$ is divisible by $A(n)$.

Problem 131
===========

There are some prime values, $p$, for which there exists a positive
integer, $n$, such that the expression $n^3 + n^2p$ is a perfect
cube.

For example, when $p = 19$, $8^3 + 8^2 \times 19 = 12^3$.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this
property the value of $n$ is unique, and there are only four such
primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

Problem 132
===========

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall
define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$.

For example, $R(10) = 1111111111 = 11 \times 41 \times 271 \times
9091$, and the sum of these prime factors is $9414$.

Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of $R(10^9)$.

Problem 133
===========

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall
define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$; for example, $R(6) =
111111$.

Let us consider repunits of the form $R(10^n)$.

Although $R(10)$, $R(100)$, or $R(1000)$ are not divisible by
$17$, $R(10000)$ is divisible by $17$. Yet there is no value of
$n$ for which $R(10^n)$ will divide by $19$. In fact, it is
remarkable that $11$, $17$, $41$, and $73$ are the only four
primes below one-hundred that can be a factor of $R(10^n)$.

Find the sum of all the primes below one-hundred thousand that will
never be a factor of $R(10^n)$.

Problem 134
===========

Consider the consecutive primes $p\_1 = 19$ and $p\_2 = 23$. It can
be verified that $1219$ is the smallest number such that the last
digits are formed by $p\_1$ whilst also being divisible by $p\_2$.

In fact, with the exception of $p\_1 = 3$ and $p\_2 = 5$, for every
pair of consecutive primes, $p\_2 \gt p\_1$, there exist values of
$n$ for which the last digits are formed by $p\_1$ and $n$ is
divisible by $p\_2$. Let $S$ be the smallest of these values of
$n$.

Find $\sum S$ for every pair of consecutive primes with $5 \le p\_1
\le 1000000$.

Problem 135
===========

Given the positive integers, $x$, $y$, and $z$, are consecutive
terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive
integer, $n$, for which the equation, $x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = n$, has
exactly two solutions is $n = 27$: $$34^2 - 27^2 - 20^2 = 12^2 -
9^2 - 6^2 = 27.$$

It turns out that $n = 1155$ is the least value which has exactly ten
solutions.

How many values of $n$ less than one million have exactly ten distinct
solutions?

Problem 136
===========

The positive integers, $x$, $y$, and $z$, are consecutive terms of
an arithmetic progression. Given that $n$ is a positive integer, the
equation, $x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = n$, has exactly one solution when $n
= 20$: $$13^2 - 10^2 - 7^2 = 20.$$

In fact there are twenty-five values of $n$ below one hundred for
which the equation has a unique solution.

How many values of $n$ less than fifty million have exactly one
solution?

Problem 137
===========

Consider the infinite polynomial series $A\_F(x) = x F\_1 + x^2 F\_2 +
x^3 F\_3 + \dots$, where $F\_k$ is the $k$th term in the
Fibonacci sequence: $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots$; that is, $F\_k =
F\_{k-1} + F\_{k-2}$, $F\_1 = 1$ and $F\_2 = 1$.

For this problem we shall be interested in values of $x$ for which
$A\_F(x)$ is a positive integer.

  -------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Surprisingly   $\begin{align\*} A\_F(\tfrac{1}{2}) &= (\tfrac{1}{2})\times 1 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^2\times 1 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^3\times 2 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^4\times 3 + (\tfrac{1}{2})^5\times 5 + \cdots \\ &= \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{4} + \tfrac{2}{8} + \tfrac{3}{16} + \tfrac{5}{32} + \cdots \\ &= 2 \end{align\*}$

Problem 138

Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, $b = 16$, and legs,
$L = 17$.

::: {.center}

:::

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the
triangle, $h = \sqrt{17^2 - 8^2} = 15$, which is one less than the
base length.

With $b = 272$ and $L = 305$, we get $h = 273$, which is one more
than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle
with the property that $h = b \pm 1$.

Find $\sum L$ for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which
$h = b \pm 1$ and $b$, $L$ are positive integers.

Problem 139
===========

Let $(a, b, c)$ represent the three sides of a right angle triangle
with integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles
together to form a square with length $c$.

For example, $(3, 4, 5)$ triangles can be placed together to form a
$5$ by $5$ square with a $1$ by $1$ hole in the middle and it
can be seen that the $5$ by $5$ square can be tiled with twenty-five
$1$ by $1$ squares.

However, if $(5, 12, 13)$ triangles were used then the hole would
measure $7$ by $7$ and these could not be used to tile the $13$ by
$13$ square.

Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred
million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to
take place?

Problem 141
===========

A positive integer, $n$, is divided by $d$ and the quotient and
remainder are $q$ and $r$ respectively. In addition $d$, $q$,
and $r$ are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric
sequence, but not necessarily in that order.

For example, $58$ divided by $6$ has quotient $9$ and remainder
$4$. It can also be seen that $4, 6, 9$ are consecutive terms in a
geometric sequence (common ratio $3/2$).
We will call such numbers, $n$, progressive.

Some progressive numbers, such as $9$ and $10404 = 102^2$, happen
to also be perfect squares.
The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is
$124657$.

Problem 142

Find the smallest $x + y + z$ with integers $x \gt y \gt z \gt 0$
such that $x + y$, $x - y$, $x + z$, $x - z$, $y + z$, $y -
z$ are all perfect squares.

Problem 143
===========

Let $ABC$ be a triangle with all interior angles being less than
$120$ degrees. Let $X$ be any point inside the triangle and let $XA
= p$, $XC = q$, and $XB = r$.

Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of $X$ such that $p
+ q + r$ was minimised.

Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles $AOB$,
$BNC$ and $AMC$ are constructed on each side of triangle $ABC$,
the circumscribed circles of $AOB$, $BNC$, and $AMC$ will
intersect at a single point, $T$, inside the triangle. Moreover he
proved that $T$, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises $p + q
+ r$. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that when the sum is
minimised, $AN = BM = CO = p + q + r$ and that $AN$, $BM$ and
$CO$ also intersect at $T$.

If the sum is minimised and $a, b, c, p, q$ and $r$ are all positive
integers we shall call triangle $ABC$ a Torricelli triangle. For

Torricelli triangle, with $p + q + r = 784$.

Find the sum of all distinct values of $p + q + r \le 120000$ for

Problem 144
===========

In laser physics, a \"white cell\" is a mirror system that acts as a
delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around
on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.

The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the
equation $4x^2 + y^2 = 100$.

The section corresponding to $-0.01 \le x \le +0.01$ at the top is
missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

:::

The light beam in this problem starts at the point $(0.0,10.1)$ just
outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at
$(1.4,-9.6)$.

Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the
usual law of reflection \"angle of incidence equals angle of
reflection.\" That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the
same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.

In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of
contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue
line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of
the first bounce.

The slope $m$ of the tangent line at any point $(x,y)$ of the given
ellipse is: $m = -4x/y$.

The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of
incidence.

The animation on the right shows the first $10$ reflections of the
beam.

How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell
before exiting?

Problem 145

Some positive integers $n$ have the property that the sum $\[n +
\operatorname{reverse}(n)\]$ consists entirely of odd (decimal)
digits. For instance, $36 + 63 = 99$ and $409 + 904 = 1313$. We will
call such numbers [reversible]{.dfn}; so $36$, $63$, $409$, and
$904$ are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either $n$
or $\operatorname{reverse}(n)$.

There are $120$ reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion ($10^9$)?

$n^2 + 3$, $n^2 + 7$, $n^2 + 9$, $n^2 + 13$, and $n^2 +

Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:

First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form
of what is known as a \"Lagged Fibonacci Generator\":

For $1 \le k \le 55$, $s\_k = \[100003 - 200003 k + 300007 k^3\]
\pmod{1000000} - 500000$.
For $56 \le k \le 4000000$, $s\_k = \[s\_{k-24} + s\_{k - 55} +
1000000\] \pmod{1000000} - 500000$.

Thus, $s\_{10} = -393027$ and $s\_{100} = 86613$.

The terms of $s$ are then arranged in a $2000 \times 2000$ table,
using the first $2000$ numbers to fill the first row (sequentially),
the next $2000$ numbers to fill the second row, and so on.

Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in
any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).

Problem 150

In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find
a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the
smallest possible.

We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we
generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers [s~k~]{style="font-style:italic;"}
in the range ±2^19^, using a type of random number generator (known as a
Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:

[t]{style="font-style:italic;"} := 0
for k = 1 up to k = 500500:
    [t]{style="font-style:italic;"} :=
(615949\*[t]{style="font-style:italic;"} + 797807) modulo 2^20^
    [s~k~]{style="font-style:italic;"} :=
[t]{style="font-style:italic;"}−2^19^

Thus: [s~1~]{style="font-style:italic;"} = 273519,
[s~2~]{style="font-style:italic;"} = −153582,
[s~3~]{style="font-style:italic;"} = 450905 etc

Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers
thus:

Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as
far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the
next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and
so on).
The \"sum of a sub-triangle\" is defined as the sum of all the elements
it contains.

A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch
requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.

Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a
large sheet of the special paper with size A1.

The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of
size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size
A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the
first batch of the week.

All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

placed back in the envelope.

Problem 152
===========

There are several ways to write the number $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as a sum of
square reciprocals using *distinct* integers.

For instance, the numbers $\{2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35\}$ can be
used:

$$\begin{align}\dfrac{1}{2} &= \dfrac{1}{2^2} + \dfrac{1}{3^2} +
\dfrac{1}{4^2} + \dfrac{1}{5^2} +\\ &\quad \dfrac{1}{7^2} +
\dfrac{1}{12^2} + \dfrac{1}{15^2} + \dfrac{1}{20^2} +\\ &\quad
\dfrac{1}{28^2} + \dfrac{1}{35^2}\end{align}$$

$\{2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45\}$.

How many ways are there to write $\dfrac{1}{2}$ as a sum of
reciprocals of squares using distinct integers between $2$ and $80$
inclusive?

Problem 153
===========

As we all know the equation $x^2=-1$ has no solutions for real
$x$.
If we however introduce the imaginary number $i$ this equation has two
solutions: $x=i$ and $x=-i$.
If we go a step further the equation $(x-3)^2=-4$ has two complex
solutions: $x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$.
$x=3+2i$ and $x=3-2i$ are called each others\' complex conjugate.
Numbers of the form $a+bi$ are called complex numbers.
In general $a+bi$ and $a-bi$ are each other\'s complex conjugate.

A Gaussian Integer is a complex number $a+bi$ such that both $a$ and
$b$ are integers.
The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with $b=0$).
To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with $b \ne 0$ we call
such integers \"rational integers.\"
A Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is called a divisor of a rational integer
$n$ if the result $\dfrac n {a + bi}$ is also a Gaussian integer.
If for example we divide $5$ by $1+2i$ we can simplify
$\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}$ in the following manner:
Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of $1+2i$:
$1-2i$.
The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1
- 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} =
\dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
So $1+2i$ is a divisor of $5$.
Note that $1+i$ is not a divisor of $5$ because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i}
= \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.
Note also that if the Gaussian Integer $(a+bi)$ is a divisor of a
rational integer $n$, then its complex conjugate $(a-bi)$ is also a
divisor of $n$.

In fact, $5$ has six divisors such that the real part is positive:
$\{1, 1 + 2i, 1 - 2i, 2 + i, 2 - i, 5\}$.
The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five
positive rational integers:

  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  $n$                   Gaussian integer        Sum $s(n)$ of

                          with positive real part 

  $1$                   $1$                   $1$

  $2$                   $1, 1+i, 1-i, 2$      $5$

  $3$                   $1, 3$                $4$

  $4$                   $1, 1+i, 1-i, 2, 2+2i, $13$

  $5$                   $1, 1+2i, 1-2i, 2+i,   $12$
                          2-i, 5$                
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------

For divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: $\sum
\limits\_{n = 1}^{5} {s(n)} = 35$.

$\sum \limits\_{n = 1}^{10^5} {s(n)} = 17924657155$.

Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each
position:

A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three
spheres directly below the current position.

Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum
of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there
are up to three numbers above it).

The result is **Pascal\'s pyramid** and the numbers at each level $n$
are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion $(x + y + z)^n$.

How many coefficients in the expansion of $(x + y + z)^{200000}$ are

Problem 155
===========

An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same
value $C$.
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form
sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with
other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on
up to a final circuit.

Using this simple procedure and up to $n$ identical capacitors, we can
make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For
example, using up to $n=3$ capacitors of $\pu{60 \mu F}$ each, we
can obtain the following $7$ distinct total capacitance values:

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0155_capacitors1.gif?1678992055){.dark_img}

we can obtain when using up to $n$ equal-valued capacitors and the
simple procedure described above, we have: $D(1)=1$, $D(2)=3$,
$D(3)=7$, $\dots$

Find $D(18)$.

*Reminder:* When connecting capacitors $C\_1, C\_2$ etc in parallel,
the total capacitance is $C\_T = C\_1 + C\_2 + \cdots$,
whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given
by: $\dfrac{1}{C\_T} = \dfrac{1}{C\_1} + \dfrac{1}{C\_2} + \cdots$

Problem 156
===========

Starting from zero the natural numbers are written down in base $10$
like this:
$0\,1\,2\,3\,4\,5\,6\,7\,8\,9\,10\,11\,12\cdots$

Consider the digit $d=1$. After we write down each number $n$, we
will update the number of ones that have occurred and call this number
$f(n,1)$. The first values for $f(n,1)$, then, are as follows:

\begin{array}{cc} n & f(n, 1)\\ \hline 0 & 0\\ 1 & 1\\ 2 & 1\
3 & 1\\ 4 & 1\\ 5 & 1\\ 6 & 1\\ 7 & 1\\ 8 & 1\\ 9 & 1\\ 10
& 2\\ 11 & 4\\ 12 & 5 \end{array}

Note that $f(n,1)$ never equals $3$.
So the first two solutions of the equation $f(n,1)=n$ are $n=0$ and
$n=1$. The next solution is $n=199981$.

In the same manner the function $f(n,d)$ gives the total number of
digits $d$ that have been written down after the number $n$ has been
written.
In fact, for every digit $d \ne 0$, $0$ is the first solution of
the equation $f(n,d)=n$.

Let $s(d)$ be the sum of all the solutions for which $f(n,d)=n$.
You are given that $s(1)=22786974071$.

Find $\sum s(d)$ for $1 \le d \le 9$.

Note: if, for some $n$, $f(n,d)=n$ for more than one value of $d$
this value of $n$ is counted again for every value of $d$ for which
$f(n,d)=n$.

Problem 158
===========

Taking three different letters from the $26$ letters of the alphabet,
character strings of length three can be formed.
Examples are \'abc\', \'hat\' and \'zyx\'.
When we study these three examples we see that for \'abc\' two
characters come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
For \'hat\' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically
after its neighbour to the left. For \'zyx\' there are zero characters
that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
In all there are $10400$ strings of length $3$ for which exactly one
character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.

We now consider strings of $n \le 26$ different characters from the
alphabet.
For every $n$, $p(n)$ is the number of strings of length $n$ for
which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour
to the left.

What is the maximum value of $p(n)$?

Problem 159
===========

A composite number can be factored many different ways. For instance,
not including multiplication by one, $24$ can be factored in $7$
distinct ways:

\begin{align} 24 &= 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3\\ 24 &= 2 \times
3 \times 4\\ 24 &= 2 \times 2 \times 6\\ 24 &= 4 \times 6\\ 24
&= 3 \times 8\\ 24 &= 2 \times 12\\ 24 &= 24 \end{align}

Recall that the digital root of a number, in base $10$, is found by
adding together the digits of that number, and repeating that process
until a number is arrived at that is less than $10$. Thus the digital
root of $467$ is $8$.

We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of
the individual factors of our number.
The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for $24$.

  Factorisation                         Digital Root Sum
  ------------------------------------- ------------------
  $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3$   $9$
  $2 \times 3 \times 4$             $9$
  $2 \times 2 \times 6$             $10$
  $4 \times 6$                       $10$
  $3 \times 8$                       $11$
  $2 \times 12$                      $5$
  $24$                                $6$

The maximum Digital Root Sum of $24$ is $11$.
The function $\operatorname{mdrs}(n)$ gives the maximum Digital Root
Sum of $n$. So $\operatorname{mdrs}(24)=11$.
Find $\sum \operatorname{mdrs}(n)$ for $1 \lt n \lt
1\,000\,000$.

Problem 160
===========

For any $N$, let $f(N)$ be the last five digits before the trailing
zeroes in $N!$.
For example,

-   $9! = 362880$ so $f(9)=36288$
-   $10! = 3628800$ so $f(10)=36288$
-   $20! = 2432902008176640000$ so $f(20)=17664$

Find $f(1\,000\,000\,000\,000)$.

Any $n$ by $m$ grid for which $n \times m$ is divisible by $3$

Problem 162
===========

In the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using $16$
different digits: $$0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\mathrm A,\mathrm B,\mathrm
C,\mathrm D,\mathrm E,\mathrm F.$$

The hexadecimal number $\mathrm{AF}$ when written in the decimal
number system equals $10 \times 16 + 15 = 175$.

In the $3$-digit hexadecimal numbers $10\mathrm A$, $1\mathrm
A0$, $\mathrm A10$, and $\mathrm A01$ the digits $0$, $1$ and
$\mathrm A$ are all present.
Like numbers written in base ten we write hexadecimal numbers without
leading zeroes.

How many hexadecimal numbers containing at most sixteen hexadecimal
digits exist with all of the digits $0$, $1$, and $\mathrm A$
present at least once?
Give your answer as a hexadecimal number.

(A, B, C, D, E and F in upper case, without any leading or trailing code
that marks the number as hexadecimal and without leading zeroes, e.g.
1A3F and not: 1a3f and not 0x1a3f and not $1A3F and not \#1A3F and not
0000001A3F)

Problem 163
===========

Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from
each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the *size
$1$* triangle in the sketch below.

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0163.gif?1678992055){.dark_img}
:::

Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or
location can now be observed in that triangle. Using *size $1$*
triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as
the *size $2$* triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four
triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location
can now be observed in that *size $2$* triangle.

It can be observed that the *size $2$* triangle contains $4$ *size
$1$* triangle building blocks. A *size $3$* triangle would contain
$9$ *size $1$* triangle building blocks and a *size $n$* triangle
would thus contain $n^2$ *size $1$* triangle building blocks.

If we denote $T(n)$ as the number of triangles present in a triangle
of *size $n$*, then

\begin{align} T(1) &= 16\\ T(2) &= 104 \end{align}

Find $T(36)$.

Problem 164
===========

How many $20$ digit numbers $n$ (without any leading zero) exist
such that no three consecutive digits of $n$ have a sum greater than
$9$?

Problem 165
===========

A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints.
By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three
possibilities:
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in
common.

Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be
the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the
segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an
endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both
segments.
We will call a common point $T$ of two segments $L\_1$ and $L\_2$
a true intersection point of $L\_1$ and $L\_2$ if $T$ is the only
common point of $L\_1$ and $L\_2$ and $T$ is an interior point of
both segments.

Consider the three segments $L\_1$, $L\_2$, and $L\_3$:

-   $L\_1$: $(27, 44)$ to $(12, 32)$
-   $L\_2$: $(46, 53)$ to $(17, 62)$
-   $L\_3$: $(46, 70)$ to $(22, 40)$

It can be verified that line segments $L\_2$ and $L\_3$ have a true
intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of
$L\_3$: $(22,40)$ lies on $L\_1$ this is not considered to be a
true point of intersection. $L\_1$ and $L\_2$ have no common point.
So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.

Now let us do the same for $5000$ line segments. To this end, we
generate $20000$ numbers using the so-called \"Blum Blum Shub\"
pseudo-random number generator.

\begin{align} s\_0 &= 290797\\ s\_{n + 1} &= s\_n \times s\_n
\pmod{50515093}\\ t\_n &= s\_n \pmod{500} \end{align}

To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers $t\_n$.
That is, the first line segment is given by:

$(t\_1, t\_2)$ to $(t\_3, t\_4)$.

The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should
be: $27$, $144$, $12$ and $232$. The first segment would thus be
$(27,144)$ to $(12,232)$.

How many distinct true intersection points are found among the $5000$
line segments?

Problem 166

A $4 \times 4$ grid is filled with digits $d$, $0 \le d \le 9$.

It can be seen that in the grid \begin{matrix} 6 & 3 & 3 & 0\\ 5 & 0
& 4 & 3\\ 0 & 7 & 1 & 4\\ 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 \end{matrix} the sum of
each row and each column has the value $12$. Moreover the sum of each
diagonal is also $12$.

In how many ways can you fill a $4 \times 4$ grid with the digits
$d$, $0 \le d \le 9$ so that each row, each column, and both
diagonals have the same sum?

Problem 167
===========

For two positive integers $a$ and $b$, the Ulam sequence $U(a,b)$
is defined by $U(a,b)\_1 = a$, $U(a,b)\_2 = b$ and for $k \gt 2$,
$U(a,b)\_k$ is the smallest integer greater than $U(a,b)\_{k - 1}$
which can be written in exactly one way as the sum of two distinct
previous members of $U(a,b)$.

For example, the sequence $U(1,2)$ begins with
$1$, $2$, $3 = 1 + 2$, $4 = 1 + 3$, $6 = 2 + 4$, $8 = 2 +
6$, $11 = 3 + 8$;
$5$ does not belong to it because $5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3$ has two
representations as the sum of two previous members, likewise $7 = 1 + 6
= 3 + 4$.

Find $\sum\limits\_{n = 2}^{10} U(2,2n+1)\_k$, where $k =
10^{11}$.

Problem 168
===========

Consider the number $142857$. We can right-rotate this number by
moving the last digit ($7$) to the front of it, giving us $714285$.
It can be verified that $714285 = 5 \times 142857$.
This demonstrates an unusual property of $142857$: it is a divisor of
its right-rotation.

Find the last $5$ digits of the sum of all integers $n$, $10 \lt n
\lt 10^{100}$, that have this property.

Problem 169
===========

Define $f(0)=1$ and $f(n)$ to be the number of different ways $n$
can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of $2$ using each power no
more than twice.

For example, $f(10)=5$ since there are five different ways to express
$10$:

\begin{align} & 1 + 1 + 8\\ & 1 + 1 + 4 + 4\\ & 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 +
4\\ & 2 + 4 + 4\\ & 2 + 8 \end{align}

Problem 170
===========

Take the number $6$ and multiply it by each of $1273$ and $9854$:

\begin{align} 6 \times 1273 &= 7638\\ 6 \times 9854 &= 59124
\end{align}

By concatenating these products we get the $1$ to $9$ pandigital
$763859124$. We will call $763859124$ the \"concatenated product of
$6$ and $(1273,9854)$\". Notice too, that the concatenation of the
input numbers, $612739854$, is also $1$ to $9$ pandigital.

The same can be done for $0$ to $9$ pandigital numbers.

What is the largest $0$ to $9$ pandigital $10$-digit concatenated
product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the
concatenation of the input numbers is also a $0$ to $9$ pandigital
$10$-digit number?

Problem 171

For a positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the squares of
the digits (in base $10$) of $n$, e.g.

\begin{align} f(3) &= 3^2 = 9,\\ f(25) &= 2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 =
29,\\ f(442) &= 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36\\ \end{align}

Find the last nine digits of the sum of all $n$, $0 \lt n \lt
10^{20}$, such that $f(n)$ is a perfect square.

We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
\"hole\" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.
For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two
different square laminae:

With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at
one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.

Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be
formed?

Problem 174
===========

We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
\"hole\" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.

Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: $3
\times 3$ square with a $1 \times 1$ hole in the middle. However,
using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.

If `t`{.variable} represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that
$t = 8$ is type $L(1)$ and $t = 32$ is type $L(2)$.

Let $N(n)$ be the number of $t \le 1000000$ such that $t$ is type
$L(n)$; for example, $N(15) = 832$.

What is $\sum\limits\_{n = 1}^{10} N(n)$?

Problem 175
===========

Define $f(0)=1$ and $f(n)$ to be the number of ways to write $n$
as a sum of powers of $2$ where no power occurs more than twice.

For example, $f(10)=5$ since there are five different ways to express
$10$:
$10 = 8+2 = 8+1+1 = 4+4+2 = 4+2+2+1+1 = 4+4+1+1.$

It can be shown that for every fraction $p / q$ ($p \gt 0$, $q
\gt 0$) there exists at least one integer $n$ such that
$f(n)/f(n-1)=p/q$.

For instance, the smallest $n$ for which $f(n)/f(n-1)=13/17$ is
$241$.
The binary expansion of $241$ is $11110001$.
Reading this binary number from the most significant bit to the least
significant bit there are $4$ one\'s, $3$ zeroes and $1$ one. We
shall call the string $4,3,1$ the [Shortened Binary Expansion]{.dfn}
of $241$.

Find the Shortened Binary Expansion of the smallest $n$ for which
$f(n)/f(n-1)=123456789/987654321$.

$(12,16,20)$, $(5,12,13)$ and $(12,35,37)$ all have one of the
shorter sides (catheti) equal to $12$. It can be shown that no other
integer sided right-angled triangle exists with one of the catheti equal
to $12$.

Find the smallest integer that can be the length of a cathetus of
exactly $47547$ different integer sided right-angled triangles.

Problem 177
===========

Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals $AC$ and
$BD$. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two
sides, creating eight corner angles.

![](resources/images/0177_quad.gif?1678992055){.dark_img}

For example, at vertex $A$, the two angles are $CAD$, $CAB$.

We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have
integer values when measured in degrees an \"integer angled
quadrilateral\". An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a
square, where all eight corner angles are $45^\circ$. Another
example is given by $DAC = 20^\circ$, $BAC = 60^\circ$, $ABD =
50^\circ$, $CBD = 30^\circ$, $BCA = 40^\circ$, $DCA =
30^\circ$, $CDB = 80^\circ$, $ADB = 50^\circ$.

It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of $45656$ has a

Find the number of integers $1 \lt n \lt 10^7$, for which $n$ and
$n + 1$ have the same number of positive divisors. For example, $14$

For any integer $n$, consider the three functions

\begin{align} f\_{1, n}(x, y, z) &= x^{n + 1} + y^{n + 1} - z^{n +
1}\\ f\_{2, n}(x, y, z) &= (xy + yz + zx) \cdot (x^{n - 1} + y^{n -
1} - z^{n - 1})\\ f\_{3, n}(x, y, z) &= xyz \cdot (x^{n - 2} +
y^{n - 2} - z^{n - 2}) \end{align}

and their combination $$f\_n(x, y, z) = f\_{1, n}(x, y, z) + f\_{2,
n}(x, y, z) - f\_{3, n}(x, y, z).$$

We call $(x, y, z)$ a golden triple of order $k$ if $x$, $y$,
and $z$ are all rational numbers of the form $a / b$ with $0 \lt a
\lt b \le k$ and there is (at least) one integer $n$, so that
$f\_n(x, y, z) = 0$.

Let $s(x, y, z) = x + y + z$.
Let $t = u / v$ be the sum of all distinct $s(x, y, z)$ for all

Problem 182
===========

The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:

Generate two distinct primes $p$ and $q$.
Compute $n = pq$ and $\phi = (p - 1)(q - 1)$.
Find an integer $e$, $1 \lt e \lt \phi$, such that $\gcd(e,
\phi) = 1$.

A message in this system is a number in the interval $\[0, n - 1\]$.
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in
the interval $\[0, n - 1\]$).
To encrypt the text, for each message, $m$, $c = m^e \bmod n$ is
calculated.

To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate $d$
such that $ed = 1 \bmod \phi$, then for each encrypted message,
$c$, calculate $m = c^d \bmod n$.

There exist values of $e$ and $m$ such that $m^e \bmod n = m$.
We call messages $m$ for which $m^e \bmod n = m$ unconcealed
messages.

An issue when choosing $e$ is that there should not be too many
unconcealed messages.
For instance, let $p = 19$ and $q = 37$.
Then $n = 19 \cdot 37 = 703$ and $\phi = 18 \cdot 36 = 648$.
If we choose $e = 181$, then, although $\gcd(181,648) = 1$ it turns
out that all possible messages $m$ ($0 \le m \le n - 1$) are
unconcealed when calculating $m^e \bmod n$.
For any valid choice of $e$ there exist some unconcealed messages.
It\'s important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.

Choose $p = 1009$ and $q = 3643$.
Find the sum of all values of $e$, $1 \lt e \lt \phi(1009,3643)$
and $\gcd(e, \phi) = 1$, so that the number of unconcealed messages
for this value of $e$ is at a minimum.

Problem 183
===========

Let $N$ be a positive integer and let $N$ be split into $k$ equal
parts, $r = N/k$, so that $N = r + r + \cdots + r$.
Let $P$ be the product of these parts, $P = r \times r \times
\cdots \times r = r^k$.

For example, if $11$ is split into five equal parts, $11 = 2.2 + 2.2
+ 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2$, then $P = 2.2^5 = 51.53632$.

Let $M(N) = P\_{\mathrm{max}}$ for a given value of $N$.

It turns out that the maximum for $N = 11$ is found by splitting
eleven into four equal parts which leads to $P\_{\mathrm{max}} =
(11/4)^4$; that is, $M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625$, which is a
terminating decimal.

However, for $N = 8$ the maximum is achieved by splitting it into
three equal parts, so $M(8) = 512/27$, which is a non-terminating
decimal.

Let $D(N) = N$ if $M(N)$ is a non-terminating decimal and $D(N) =
-N$ if $M(N)$ is a terminating decimal.

For example, $\sum\limits\_{N = 5}^{100} D(N)$ is $2438$.

Find $\sum\limits\_{N = 5}^{10000} D(N)$.

How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and
having all three vertices in $I\_{105}$?

===========

The game Number Mind is a variant of the well known game Master Mind.

Instead of coloured pegs, you have to guess a secret sequence of digits.
After each guess you\'re only told in how many places you\'ve guessed
the correct digit. So, if the sequence was 1234 and you guessed 2036,
you\'d be told that you have one correct digit; however, you would NOT
be told that you also have another digit in the wrong place.

For instance, given the following guesses for a 5-digit secret sequence,

90342 ;2 correct
70794 ;0 correct
39458 ;2 correct
34109 ;1 correct
51545 ;2 correct
12531 ;1 correct

The correct sequence 39542 is unique.

Based on the following guesses,

5616185650518293 ;2 correct

Problem 186
===========

Here are the records from a busy telephone system with one million
users:

::: {.center}
      RecNr        Caller        Called
  ------------- ------------- -------------
      $1$      $200007$    $100053$
      $2$      $600183$    $500439$
      $3$      $600863$    $701497$
   $\cdots$   $\cdots$   $\cdots$
:::

The telephone number of the caller and the called number in record $n$
are $\operatorname{Caller}(n) = S\_{2n-1}$ and
$\operatorname{Called}(n) = S\_{2n}$ where $S\_{1,2,3,\dots}$ come
from the \"Lagged Fibonacci Generator\":

For $1 \le k \le 55$, $S\_k = \[100003 - 200003k + 300007k^3\]
\pmod{1000000}$.
For $56 \le k$, $S\_k = \[S\_{k-24} + S\_{k-55}\] \pmod{1000000}$.

If $\operatorname{Caller}(n) = \operatorname{Called}(n)$ then the
user is assumed to have misdialled and the call fails; otherwise the
call is successful.

From the start of the records, we say that any pair of users $X$ and
$Y$ are friends if $X$ calls $Y$ or vice-versa. Similarly, $X$
is a friend of a friend of $Z$ if $X$ is a friend of $Y$ and $Y$
is a friend of $Z$; and so on for longer chains.

The Prime Minister\'s phone number is $524287$. After how many
successful calls, not counting misdials, will $99\%$ of the users
(including the PM) be a friend, or a friend of a friend etc., of the
Prime Minister?

Problem 187
===========

A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For
example, $15 = 3 \times 5$; $9 = 3 \times 3$; $12 = 2 \times 2
\times 3$.

There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not
necessarily distinct, prime factors: $4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25,
26$.

How many composite integers, $n \lt 10^8$, have precisely two, not
necessarily distinct, prime factors?

Problem 188
===========

The **hyperexponentiation** or **tetration** of a number $a$ by a
positive integer $b$, denoted by $a\mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow}b$
or $^b a$, is recursively defined by:

$a \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 1 = a$,
$a \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} (k+1) = a^{(a \mathbin{\uparrow
\uparrow} k)}$.

Thus we have e.g. $3 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 2 = 3^3 = 27$,
hence $3 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 3 = 3^{27} = 7625597484987$
and $3 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow} 4$ is roughly
$10^{3.6383346400240996 \cdot 10^{12}}$.

Find the last $8$ digits of $1777 \mathbin{\uparrow \uparrow}
1855$.

Problem 189
===========

Consider the following configuration of $64$ triangles:

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0189_grid.gif?1678992055){.dark_img}
:::

We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three
colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have
the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two
triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.
Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.

For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0189_colours.gif?1678992055){.dark_img}
:::

A colouring $C^\prime$ which is obtained from a colouring $C$ by
rotation or reflection is considered *distinct* from $C$ unless the
two are identical.

How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above
configuration?

Problem 190

Let $S\_m = (x\_1, x\_2, \dots , x\_m)$ be the $m$-tuple of
positive real numbers with $x\_1 + x\_2 + \cdots + x\_m = m$ for
which $P\_m = x\_1 \cdot x\_2^2 \cdot \cdots \cdot x\_m^m$ is
maximised.

For example, it can be verified that $\lfloor P\_{10}\rfloor = 4112$
($\lfloor \, \rfloor$ is the integer part function).

Find $\sum\limits\_{m = 2}^{15} \lfloor P\_m \rfloor$.

Problem 191
===========

A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance
and punctuality. If they are absent for three consecutive days or late
on more than one occasion then they forfeit their prize.

During an n-day period a trinary string is formed for each child
consisting of L\'s (late), O\'s (on time), and A\'s (absent).

Although there are eighty-one trinary strings for a 4-day period that
can be formed, exactly forty-three strings would lead to a prize:

OOOO OOOA OOOL OOAO OOAA OOAL OOLO OOLA OAOO OAOA
OAOL OAAO OAAL OALO OALA OLOO OLOA OLAO OLAA AOOO
AOOA AOOL AOAO AOAA AOAL AOLO AOLA AAOO AAOA AAOL

How many \"prize\" strings exist over a 30-day period?

Problem 192
===========

Let $x$ be a real number.
A **best approximation** to $x$ for the **denominator bound** $d$ is
a rational number $\frac r s $ in **reduced form**, with $s \le
d$, such that any rational number which is closer to $x$ than
$\frac r s$ has a denominator larger than $d$:

::: {.center}
$\|\frac p q -x \| \< \|\frac r s -x\| \Rightarrow q \> d$
:::

For example, the best approximation to $\sqrt {13}$ for the
denominator bound 20 is $\frac {18} 5$ and the best approximation to
$\sqrt {13}$ for the denominator bound 30 is $\frac {101}{28}$.

Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to $\sqrt
n$ for the denominator bound $10^{12}$, where $n$ is not a perfect
square and $ 1 \< n \le 100000$.

Problem 193
===========

A positive integer $n$ is called squarefree, if no square of a prime
divides $n$, thus $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11$ are squarefree, but not
$4, 8, 9, 12$.

How many squarefree numbers are there below $2^{50}$?

Problem 194

units are glued along the vertical edges as in the graph
![](resources/images/0194_Fig.png?1678992052){.dark_img}.

A configuration of type $(a, b, c)$ is a graph thus built of $a$
units $A$ and $b$ units $B$, where the graph\'s vertices are
coloured using up to $c$ colours, so that no two adjacent vertices
have the same colour.
The compound graph above is an example of a configuration of type
$(2,2,6)$, in fact of type $(2,2,c)$ for all $c \ge 4$.

Let $N(a, b, c)$ be the number of configurations of type $(a, b,
c)$.
For example, $N(1,0,3) = 24$, $N(0,2,4) = 92928$ and $N(2,2,3) =
20736$.

Find the last $8$ digits of $N(25,75,1984)$.

Problem 195
===========

Let\'s call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of $60$
degrees a $60$-degree triangle.
Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a $60$-degree
triangle.

There are $1234$ $60$-degree triangles for which $r \le 100$.
Let $T(n)$ be the number of $60$-degree triangles for which $r \le
n$, so
$T(100) = 1234$, $T(1000) = 22767$, and $T(10000) = 359912$.

Find $T(1053779)$.

Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.

A set of three primes is called a [prime triplet]{.dfn} if one of the
three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.

For example, in the second row, the prime numbers $2$ and $3$ are
elements of some prime triplet.

If row $8$ is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of
some prime triplet, i.e. $29$ and $31$.
If row $9$ is considered, it contains only one prime which is an
element of some prime triplet: $37$.

Define $S(n)$ as the sum of the primes in row $n$ which are elements
of any prime triplet.
Then $S(8)=60$ and $S(9)=37$.

You are given that $S(10000)=950007619$.

Find $S(5678027) + S(7208785)$.

Problem 197
===========

Given is the function $f(x) = \lfloor 2^{30.403243784 - x^2}\rfloor
\times 10^{-9}$ ($\lfloor \, \rfloor$ is the floor-function),
the sequence $u\_n$ is defined by $u\_0 = -1$ and $u\_{n + 1} =
f(u\_n)$.

Find $u\_n + u\_{n + 1}$ for $n = 10^{12}$.
Give your answer with $9$ digits after the decimal point.

Problem 198
===========

A best approximation to a real number $x$ for the denominator bound
$d$ is a rational number $\frac r s$ (in reduced form) with $s
\le d$, so that any rational number $\frac p q$ which is closer to
$x$ than $\frac r s$ has $q \gt d$.

Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined
for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g.
$\frac 9 {40}$ has the two best approximations $\frac 1 4$ and
$\frac 1 5$ for the denominator bound $6$. We shall call a real
number $x$ [ambiguous]{.dfn}, if there is at least one denominator
bound for which $x$ possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an
ambiguous number is necessarily rational.

How many ambiguous numbers $x=\frac p q, 0 \lt x \lt \frac 1
{100}$, are there whose denominator $q$ does not exceed $10^8$?

Problem 199
===========

Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such
that each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner
circles do not overlap. There are four uncovered \"gaps\" which are to
be filled iteratively with more tangent circles.

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0199_circles_in_circles.gif?1678992055){.dark_img}
:::

At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which
creates more gaps for the next iteration. After $3$ iterations
(pictured), there are $108$ gaps and the fraction of the area which is
not covered by circles is $0.06790342$, rounded to eight decimal
places.

What fraction of the area is not covered by circles after $10$
iterations?
Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places using the format
x.xxxxxxxx .

Problem 200
===========

We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, $p^2 q^3$, where
$p$ and $q$ are distinct primes.
For example, $200 = 5^2 2^3$ or $120072949 = 23^2 61^3$.

The first five squbes are $72, 108, 200, 392$, and $500$.

Interestingly, $200$ is also the first number for which you cannot
change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers,
prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous
sub-string \"$200$\" is $1992008$.

Find the $200$th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous
sub-string \"$200$\".

Problem 201
===========

For any set $A$ of numbers, let $\operatorname{sum}(A)$ be the sum
of the elements of $A$.
Consider the set $B = \{1,3,6,8,10,11\}$.
There are $20$ subsets of $B$ containing three elements, and their
sums are:

\begin{align} \operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,6\}) &= 10,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,8\}) &= 12,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,10\}) &= 14,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,3,11\}) &= 15,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,6,8\}) &= 15,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,6,10\}) &= 17,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,6,11\}) &= 18,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,8,10\}) &= 19,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,8,11\}) &= 20,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{1,10,11\}) &= 22,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,6,8\}) &= 17,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,6,10\}) &= 19,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,6,11\}) &= 20,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,8,10\}) &= 21,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,8,11\}) &= 22,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{3,10,11\}) &= 24,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{6,8,10\}) &= 24,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{6,8,11\}) &= 25,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{6,10,11\}) &= 27,\
\operatorname{sum}(\{8,10,11\}) &= 29. \end{align}

Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique.
For a set $A$, let $U(A,k)$ be the set of unique sums of
$k$-element subsets of $A$, in our example we find $U(B,3) =
\{10,12,14,18,21,25,27,29\}$ and $\operatorname{sum}(U(B,3)) =
156$.

Now consider the $100$-element set $S = \{1^2, 2^2, \dots,
100^2\}$.
S has $100891344545564193334812497256$ $50$-element subsets.

Determine the sum of all integers which are the sum of exactly one of
the $50$-element subsets of $S$, i.e. find
$\operatorname{sum}(U(S,50))$.

Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with
their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal
gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.

Label the vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$. There are $2$ ways in which
a laser beam may enter vertex $C$, bounce off $11$ surfaces, then
exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the
reverse of that.

twelve distinct numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 21 and 35.

A positive integer `n`{.variable} is called squarefree if no square of a

first eight rows of Pascal\'s triangle, all except 4 and 20 are
squarefree. The sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first
eight rows is 105.

Find the sum of the distinct squarefree numbers in the first 51 rows of
Pascal\'s triangle.

A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger
than $5$.
So the first few Hamming numbers are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,
15$.
There are $1105$ Hamming numbers not exceeding $10^8$.

We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type
$n$, if it has no prime factor larger than $n$.
Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type
$5$.

How many generalised Hamming numbers of type $100$ are there which

For some positive integers $k$, there exists an integer partition of
the form $4^t = 2^t + k$,
where $4^t$, $2^t$, and $k$ are all positive integers and $t$
is a real number.

The first two such partitions are $4^1 = 2^1 + 2$ and
$4^{1.5849625\cdots} = 2^{1.5849625\cdots} + 6$.

Partitions where $t$ is also an integer are called [perfect]{.dfn}.
For any $m \ge 1$ let $P(m)$ be the proportion of such partitions
that are perfect with $k \le m$.
Thus $P(6) = 1/2$.

In the following table are listed some values of $P(m)$.

Let $O$ be the point $(0,0)$ and $C$ the point $(r/4,r/4)$.
Let $N(r)$ be the number of points $B$ in $S(r)$, so that the

-   For $56 \le k$, $S\_k = \[S\_{k -24} + S\_{k - 55}\]

A $30 \times 30$ grid of squares contains $900$ fleas, initially
one flea per square.

What is the expected number of unoccupied squares after $50$ rings of
the bell? Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

Problem 214
===========

Let $\phi$ be Euler\'s totient function, i.e. for a natural number
$n$, $\phi(n)$ is the number of $k$, $1 \le k \le n$, for
which $\gcd(k, n) = 1$.

By iterating $\phi$, each positive integer generates a decreasing
chain of numbers ending in $1$.
E.g. if we start with $5$ the sequence $5,4,2,1$ is generated.
Here is a listing of all chains with length $4$:

\begin{align} 5,4,2,1&\\ 7,6,2,1&\\ 8,4,2,1&\\ 9,6,2,1&\
10,4,2,1&\\ 12,4,2,1&\\ 14,6,2,1&\\ 18,6,2,1 \end{align}

Only two of these chains start with a prime, their sum is $12$.

What is the sum of all primes less than $40000000$ which generate a
chain of length $25$?

Consider the problem of building a wall out of $2 \times 1$ and $3
\times 1$ bricks ($\text{horizontal} \times \text{vertical}$
dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between
horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e.
never form a \"running crack\".

For example, the following $9 \times 3$ wall is not acceptable due to
the running crack shown in red:

Consider numbers $t(n)$ of the form $t(n) = 2n^2 - 1$ with $n \gt
1$.
The first such numbers are $7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127$ and $161$.
It turns out that only $49 = 7 \cdot 7$ and $161 = 7 \cdot 23$ are
not prime.
For $n \le 10000$ there are $2202$ numbers $t(n)$ that are prime.

How many numbers $t(n)$ are prime for $n \le 50\,000\,000$?

Problem 217
===========

A positive integer with $k$ (decimal) digits is called balanced if its
first $\lceil k/2 \rceil$ digits sum to the same value as its last
$\lceil k/2 \rceil$ digits, where $\lceil x \rceil$, pronounced
*ceiling* of $x$, is the smallest integer $\ge x$, thus $\lceil
\pi \rceil = 4$ and $\lceil 5 \rceil = 5$.

So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is $13722$.

Let $T(n)$ be the sum of all balanced numbers less than $10^n$.
Thus: $T(1) = 45$, $T(2) = 540$ and $T(5) = 334795890$.

Find $T(47) \bmod 3^{15}$.

Consider the right angled triangle with sides $a=7$, $b=24$ and
$c=25$. The area of this triangle is $84$, which is divisible by the
perfect numbers $6$ and $28$.
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as $\gcd(a,b)=1$ and
$\gcd(b,c)=1$.
Also $c$ is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
-it is a primitive right angled triangle
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers $6$ and $28$.

How many perfect right-angled triangles with $c \le 10^{16}$ exist
that are not super-perfect?

Problem 219
===========

Let [A]{style="font-weight:bold;"} and [B]{style="font-weight:bold;"} be
bit strings (sequences of 0\'s and 1\'s).
If [A]{style="font-weight:bold;"} is equal to the
[left]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}most
length([A]{style="font-weight:bold;"}) bits of
[B]{style="font-weight:bold;"}, then [A]{style="font-weight:bold;"} is
said to be a [prefix]{style="font-style:italic;"} of
[B]{style="font-weight:bold;"}.
For example, 00110 is a prefix of
[00110]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}1001, but not of 00111 or
100110.

A [prefix-free code of size]{style="font-style:italic;"} `n`{.variable}
is a collection of `n`{.variable} distinct bit strings such that no
string is a prefix of any other. For example, this is a prefix-free code
of size 6:

0000, 0001, 001, 01, 10, 11

Now suppose that it costs one penny to transmit a \'0\' bit, but four
pence to transmit a \'1\'.
Then the total cost of the prefix-free code shown above is 35 pence,
which happens to be the cheapest possible for the skewed pricing scheme
in question.
In short, we write Cost(6) = 35.

What is Cost(10^9^) ?

Let ***D***~0~ be the two-letter string \"Fa\". For n≥1, derive
***D***~n~ from ***D***~n-1~ by the string-rewriting rules:

\"a\" → \"aRbFR\"
\"b\" → \"LFaLb\"

Thus, ***D***~0~ = \"Fa\", ***D***~1~ = \"FaRbFR\", ***D***~2~ =
\"FaRbFRRLFaLbFR\", and so on.

These strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics
program, with \"F\" meaning \"draw forward one unit\", \"L\" meaning
\"turn left 90 degrees\", \"R\" meaning \"turn right 90 degrees\", and
\"a\" and \"b\" being ignored. The initial position of the computer
cursor is (0,0), pointing up towards (0,1).

Then ***D***~n~ is an exotic drawing known as the *Heighway Dragon* of

[The Chase]{.dfn} is a game played with two dice and an even number of
players.

The players sit around a table and the game begins with two opposite
players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die
roll it.

If the player rolls 1, then the die passes to the neighbour on the
left.
If the player rolls 6, then the die passes to the neighbour on the
right.
Otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.

The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled
and passed; that player has then lost.

In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the
game lasts?

Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.

Problem 228

Let $S\_n$ be the regular $n$-sided polygon -- or [shape]{.dfn} --
whose vertices $v\_k$ ($k = 1, 2, \dots, n$) have coordinates:

\begin{align} x\_k &= \cos((2k - 1)/n \times 180^\circ)\\ y\_k &=
\sin((2k - 1)/n \times 180^\circ) \end{align}

Each $S\_n$ is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all
points on the perimeter and in the interior.

The **Minkowski sum**, $S + T$, of two shapes $S$ and $T$ is the
result of adding every point in $S$ to every point in $T$, where
point addition is performed coordinate-wise: $(u, v) + (x, y) = (u + x,
v + y)$.

For example, the sum of $S\_3$ and $S\_4$ is the six-sided shape
shown in pink below:

Consider the number $3600$. It is very special, because

\begin{alignat}{2} 3600 &= 48^2 + &&36^2\\ 3600 &= 20^2 + 2
\times &&40^2\\ 3600 &= 30^2 + 3 \times &&30^2\\ 3600 &= 45^2
+ 7 \times &&15^2 \end{alignat}

Similarly, we find that $88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2 \times
54^2 = 283^2 + 3 \times 52^2 = 197^2 + 7 \times 84^2$.

In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two
squares. We are interested in the numbers $n$ which admit
representations of all of the following four types:

\begin{alignat}{2} n &= a\_1^2 + && b\_1^2\\ n &= a\_2^2 + 2 &&
b\_2^2\\ n &= a\_3^2 + 3 && b\_3^2\\ n &= a\_7^2 + 7 && b\_7^2,

There are $75373$ such numbers that do not exceed $10^7$.
How many such numbers are there that do not exceed $2 \times 10^9$?

Problem 230
===========

For any two strings of digits, $A$ and $B$, we define $F\_{A, B}$
to be the sequence $(A,B,AB,BAB,ABBAB,\dots)$ in which each term is
the concatenation of the previous two.

Further, we define $D\_{A, B}(n)$ to be the $n$^th^ digit in the
first term of $F\_{A, B}$ that contains at least $n$ digits.

Example:

Let $A=1415926535$, $B=8979323846$. We wish to find $D\_{A,
B}(35)$, say.

The first few terms of $F\_{A, B}$ are:
$1415926535$
$8979323846$
$14159265358979323846$
$897932384614159265358979323846$
$1415926535897932384689793238461415{\color{red}\mathbf
9}265358979323846$

Then $D\_{A, B}(35)$ is the $35$^th^ digit in the fifth term, which
is $9$.

Now we use for $A$ the first $100$ digits of $\pi$ behind the
decimal point:

$14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510$
$58209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679$

The binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.
$120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3

So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle

Player 2 scores $2^{T-1}$ points; otherwise, no points are scored.

Player 1 goes first and the winner is the first to 100 or more points.

Player 2 will always select the number, $T$, of coin tosses that

For an integer $n \ge 4$, we define the [lower prime square
root]{.dfn} of $n$, denoted by $\operatorname{lps}(n)$, as the
largest prime $\le \sqrt n$ and the [upper prime square root]{.dfn}
of $n$, $\operatorname{ups}(n)$, as the smallest prime $\ge
\sqrt n$.

So, for example, $\operatorname{lps}(4) = 2 =
\operatorname{ups}(4)$, $\operatorname{lps}(1000) = 31$,
$\operatorname{ups}(1000) = 37$.
Let us call an integer $n \ge 4$ [semidivisible]{.dfn}, if one of
$\operatorname{lps}(n)$ and $\operatorname{ups}(n)$ divides $n$,
but not both.

The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding $15$ is $30$, the
numbers are $8$, $10$ and $12$.
$15$ is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both
$\operatorname{lps}(15) = 3$ and $\operatorname{ups}(15) = 5$.
As a further example, the sum of the $92$ semidivisible numbers up to
$1000$ is $34825$.

Suppliers \'A\' and \'B\' provided the following numbers of products for

  Vintage Port         5760    3776
  Champagne Truffles   3936    5664

Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect
condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - *i.e.* products gone bad.

The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:

-   The five *per-product spoilage rates* for each supplier are equal to
    the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products
    supplied, for each of the five products in turn.
-   The *overall spoilage rate* for each supplier is equal to the total
    number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products
    provided by that supplier.

To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product
spoilage rates was worse (higher) for \'B\' than for \'A\' by the same
factor (ratio of spoilage rates), `m`{.variable}\>1; and yet,
paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for \'A\' than for
\'B\', also by a factor of `m`{.variable}.

There are thirty-five `m`{.variable}\>1 for which this surprising result
could have occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.

What\'s the largest possible value of `m`{.variable}?

Create a sequence of numbers using the \"Blum Blum Shub\" pseudo-random
number generator:

\begin{align} s\_0 &= 14025256\\ s\_{n + 1} &= s\_n^2 \bmod
20300713 \end{align}

Concatenate these numbers $s\_0s\_1s\_2\cdots$ to create a string
$w$ of infinite length.
Then, $w = {\color{blue}14025256741014958470038053646\cdots}$

For a positive integer $k$, if no substring of $w$ exists with a sum
of digits equal to $k$, $p(k)$ is defined to be zero. If at least
one substring of $w$ exists with a sum of digits equal to $k$, we
define $p(k) = z$, where $z$ is the starting position of the
earliest such substring.

For instance:

The substrings $\color{blue}1, 14, 1402, \dots$
with respective sums of digits equal to $1, 5, 7, \dots$
start at position $\mathbf 1$, hence $p(1) = p(5) = p(7) = \cdots =
\mathbf 1$.

The substrings $\color{blue}4, 402, 4025, \dots$
with respective sums of digits equal to $4, 6, 11, \dots$
start at position $\mathbf 2$, hence $p(4) = p(6) = p(11) = \cdots
= \mathbf 2$.

The substrings $\color{blue}02, 0252, \dots$
with respective sums of digits equal to $2, 9, \dots$
start at position $\mathbf 3$, hence $p(2) = p(9) = \cdots =
\mathbf 3$.

Note that substring $\color{blue}025$ starting at position $\mathbf
3$, has a sum of digits equal to $7$, but there was an earlier
substring (starting at position $\mathbf 1$) with a sum of digits
equal to $7$, so $p(7) = 1$, *not* $3$.

We can verify that, for $0 \lt k \le 10^3$, $\sum p(k) = 4742$.

Find $\sum p(k)$, for $0 \lt k \le 2 \times 10^{15}$.

Given the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we define $f(n, k)$ as the
number of its $k$-element subsets with an odd sum of elements. For
example, $f(5,3) = 4$, since the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ has four
$3$-element subsets having an odd sum of elements, i.e.:
$\{1,2,4\}$, $\{1,3,5\}$, $\{2,3,4\}$ and $\{2,4,5\}$.

When all three values $n$, $k$ and $f(n, k)$ are odd, we say that
they make an [odd-triplet]{.dfn} $\[n,k,f(n, k)\]$.

There are exactly five odd-triplets with $n \le 10$, namely:

Problem 243
===========

A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is
called a proper fraction.
For any denominator, $d$, there will be $d - 1$ proper fractions;
for example, with $d = 12$:
$1 / 12, 2 / 12, 3 / 12, 4 / 12, 5 / 12, 6 / 12, 7 / 12, 8 / 12, 9 /
12, 10 / 12, 11 / 12$.

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a [resilient
fraction]{.dfn}.
Furthermore we shall define the [resilience]{.dfn} of a denominator,
$R(d)$, to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient;
for example, $R(12) = 4/11$.
In fact, $d = 12$ is the smallest denominator having a resilience
$R(d) \lt 4/10$.

Find the smallest denominator $d$, having a resilience $R(d) \lt
15499/94744$.

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient
fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, $R(d)$,
to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example,
$R(12) = \dfrac{4}{11}$.

The resilience of a number $d \gt 1$ is then $\dfrac{\varphi(d)}{d

We further define the [coresilience]{.dfn} of a number $n \gt 1$ as

Problem 253

A small child has a "number caterpillar" consisting of forty jigsaw
pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a
line, reveal the numbers $1$ to $40$ in order.

Every night, the child\'s father has to pick up the pieces of the
caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up
the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.
As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments
that gradually merge together.
The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally
increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before
finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).

For example:

Problem 254

Define $f(n)$ as the sum of the factorials of the digits of $n$. For
example, $f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32$.

Define $sf(n)$ as the sum of the digits of $f(n)$. So $sf(342) = 3
+ 2 = 5$.

Define $g(i)$ to be the smallest positive integer $n$ such that
$sf(n) = i$. Though $sf(342)$ is $5$, $sf(25)$ is also $5$,
and it can be verified that $g(5)$ is $25$.

Define $sg(i)$ as the sum of the digits of $g(i)$. So $sg(5) = 2 +
5 = 7$.

Further, it can be verified that $g(20)$ is $267$ and $\sum
sg(i)$ for $1 \le i \le 20$ is $156$.

What is $\sum sg(i)$ for $1 \le i \le 150$?

Problem 255
===========

We define the [rounded-square-root]{.dfn} of a positive integer $n$ as
the square root of $n$ rounded to the nearest integer.

The following procedure (essentially Heron\'s method adapted to integer
arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of $n$:

Let $d$ be the number of digits of the number $n$.
If $d$ is odd, set $x\_0 = 2 \times 10^{(d-1)/2}$.
If $d$ is even, set $x\_0 = 7 \times 10^{(d-2)/2}$.
Repeat:

$$x\_{k+1} = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{x\_k + \lceil{n /
x\_k}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor$$

until $x\_{k+1} = x\_k$.

As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of $n = 4321$.
$n$ has $4$ digits, so $x\_0 = 7 \times 10^{(4-2)/2} = 70$.
$$x\_1 = \Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{70 + \lceil{4321 /
70}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$ $$x\_2 =
\Biggl\lfloor{\dfrac{66 + \lceil{4321 /
66}\rceil}{2}}\Biggr\rfloor = 66$$ Since $x\_2 = x\_1$, we stop
here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the
rounded-square-root of $4321$ is $66$ (the actual square root is
$65.7343137\cdots$).

The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly
low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a $5$-digit
integer ($10\,000 \le n \le 99\,999$) with an average of
$3.2102888889$ iterations (the average value was rounded to $10$
decimal places).

Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of
iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a $14$-digit
number ($10^{13} \le n \lt 10^{14}$)?
Give your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.

Note: The symbols $\lfloor x \rfloor$ and $\lceil x \rceil$

$x$]{.tooltiptext}** and **ceiling function[the smallest integer not

Problem 256
===========

Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a
room, without overlap.

Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions $1
\times 2$, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size
of the rooms that can be covered.

For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer
dimensions $a, b$ and even size $s = a \cdot b$.
We use the term \'size\' to denote the floor surface area of the room,
and --- without loss of generality --- we add the condition $a \le
b$.

There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no
points where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a $4 \times 4$
room:

::: {align="center"}
![0256\_tatami3.gif](resources/images/0256_tatami3.gif?1678992056)
:::

The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right
is not: a red \"[**X**]{style="color:#FF0000;"}\" in the middle, marks
the point where four tatami meet.

Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with
tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define $T(s)$ as the number of tatami-free rooms of size
$s$.

The smallest tatami-free room has size $s = 70$ and dimensions $7
\times 10$.
All the other rooms of size $s = 70$ can be covered with tatami; they
are: $1 \times 70$, $2 \times 35$ and $5 \times 14$.
Hence, $T(70) = 1$.

Similarly, we can verify that $T(1320) = 5$ because there are exactly
$5$ tatami-free rooms of size $s = 1320$:
$20 \times 66$, $22 \times 60$, $24 \times 55$, $30 \times
44$ and $33 \times 40$.
In fact, $s = 1320$ is the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) =
5$.

Find the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) = 200$.

A positive integer will be called [reachable]{.dfn} if it can result
from an arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:

-   Uses the digits $1$ through $9$, in that order and exactly once
    each.
-   Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the
    digits $2$, $3$ and $4$ we obtain the number $234$).
-   Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition,
    subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed.

-   **Unary minus[A minus sign applied to a single operand (as opposed

Problem 260
===========

A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
On each player\'s turn, the player may remove one or more stones from
the piles. However, if the player takes stones from more than one pile,
then the same number of stones must be removed from each of the selected
piles.

In other words, the player chooses some $N \gt 0$ and removes:

-   $N$ stones from any single pile; or
-   $N$ stones from each of any two piles ($2N$ total); or
-   $N$ stones from each of the three piles ($3N$ total).

The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.

A [winning configuration]{.dfn} is one where the first player can force
a win.
For example, $(0,0,13)$, $(0,11,11)$, and $(5,5,5)$ are winning
configurations because the first player can immediately remove all
stones.

A [losing configuration]{.dfn} is one where the second player can force
a win, no matter what the first player does.
For example, $(0,1,2)$ and $(1,3,3)$ are losing configurations: any
legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.

Consider all losing configurations $(x\_i, y\_i, z\_i)$ where $x\_i
\le y\_i \le z\_i \le 100$.
We can verify that $\sum (x\_i + y\_i + z\_i) = 173895$ for these.

Find $\sum (x\_i + y\_i + z\_i)$ where $(x\_i, y\_i, z\_i)$ ranges

A mosquito intends to fly from $A(200,200)$ to $B(1400,1400)$,

Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a
point $A^\prime$, having elevation $f$. Then, while remaining at
the same elevation $f$, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives
at a point $B^\prime$ directly above $B$.

First, determine $f\_{\mathrm{min}}$ which is the minimum constant
elevation allowing such a trip from $A$ to $B$, while remaining in

Problem 265
===========

$2^N$ binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the
$N$-digit clockwise subsequences are distinct.

For $N=3$, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring
rotations:

::: {align="center"}
![0265\_BinaryCircles.gif](resources/images/0265_BinaryCircles.gif?1678992056){.dark_img}
:::

For the first arrangement, the $3$-digit subsequences, in clockwise
order, are:
$000$, $001$, $010$, $101$, $011$, $111$, $110$ and
$100$.

Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating
the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most
significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for
$N=3$ are thus represented as $23$ and $29$:

\begin{align} 00010111\_2 &= 23\\ 00011101\_2 &= 29 \end{align}

Calling $S(N)$ the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can
see that $S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52$.

Find $S(5)$.

===========

You are given a unique investment opportunity.

Starting with £1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion,
`f`{.variable}, of your capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly
for 1000 tosses.

Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for
tails.

For example, if `f`{.variable} = 1/4, for the first toss you bet £0.25,
and if heads comes up you win £0.5 and so then have £1.5. You then bet
£0.375 and if the second toss is tails, you have £1.125.

Choosing `f`{.variable} to maximize your chances of having at least
£1,000,000,000 after 1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a
billionaire?

Problem 269
===========

A root or zero of a polynomial $P(x)$ is a solution to the equation
$P(x) = 0$.
Define $P\_n$ as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of
$n$.
For example, $P\_{5703}(x) = 5x^3 + 7x^2 + 3$.

We can see that:

-   $P\_n(0)$ is the last digit of $n$,
-   $P\_n(1)$ is the sum of the digits of $n$,
-   $P\_n(10)$ is $n$ itself.

Define $Z(k)$ as the number of positive integers, $n$, not exceeding
$k$ for which the polynomial $P\_n$ has at least one integer root.

It can be verified that $Z(100\,000)$ is $14696$.

Problem 270
===========

A square piece of paper with integer dimensions $N \times N$ is
placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the $x$-
and $y$-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:

-   We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different
    sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.
-   Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border
    point.
-   Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.

Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call $C(N)$ the
number of ways to cut an $N \times N$ square. For example, $C(1) =
2$ and $C(2) = 30$ (shown below).

When $n=91$, there are $8$ possible values for $x$, namely: $9,
16, 22, 29, 53, 74, 79, 81$.
Thus, $S(91)=9+16+22+29+53+74+79+81=363$.

Find $S(13082761331670030)$.

Problem 272

For a positive number $n$, define $C(n)$ as the number of the
integers $x$, for which $1 \lt x \lt n$ and

When $n=91$, there are $8$ possible values for $x$, namely: $9,

Problem 273
===========

Consider equations of the form: $a^2 + b^2 = N$, $0 \le a \le
b$, $a$, $b$ and $N$ integer.

For $N=65$ there are two solutions:

$a=1$, $b=8$ and $a=4$, $b=7$.

We call $S(N)$ the sum of the values of $a$ of all solutions of
$a^2 + b^2 = N$, $0 \le a \le b$, $a$, $b$ and $N$
integer.

Thus $S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5$.

Find $\sum S(N)$, for all squarefree $N$ only divisible by primes
of the form $4k+1$ with $4k+1 \lt 150$.

Problem 274
===========

For each integer $p \gt 1$ coprime to $10$ there is a positive
[divisibility multiplier]{.dfn} $m \lt p$ which preserves
divisibility by $p$ for the following function on any positive
integer, $n$:

$f(n) = (\text{all but the last digit of }n) + (\text{the last digit
of }n) \cdot m$.

That is, if $m$ is the divisibility multiplier for $p$, then
$f(n)$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by
$p$.

(When $n$ is much larger than $p$, $f(n)$ will be less than $n$
and repeated application of $f$ provides a multiplicative divisibility
test for $p$.)

For example, the divisibility multiplier for $113$ is $34$.

$f(76275) = 7627 + 5 \cdot 34 = 7797$: $76275$ and $7797$ are
both divisible by $113$.
$f(12345) = 1234 + 5 \cdot 34 = 1404$: $12345$ and $1404$ are
both not divisible by $113$.

The sum of the divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime
to $10$ and less than $1000$ is $39517$. What is the sum of the
divisibility multipliers for the primes that are coprime to $10$ and
less than $10^7$?

Problem 275
===========

Let us define a [balanced sculpture]{.dfn} of order $n$ as follows:

-   A **polyomino[An arrangement of identical squares connected through
    shared edges; holes are allowed.]{.tooltiptext}** made up of $n +
    1$ tiles known as the [blocks]{.dfn} ($n$ tiles)
    and the [plinth]{.dfn} (remaining tile);
-   the plinth has its centre at position ($x = 0, y = 0$);
-   the blocks have $y$-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth
    is the unique lowest tile);
-   the centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has $x$-coordinate
    equal to zero.

When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply
reflections about the $y$-axis, are [not]{.underline} counted as
distinct. For example, the $18$ balanced sculptures of order $6$ are
shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the $y$-axis)
is counted as one sculpture:

Consider the triangles with integer sides $a$, $b$ and $c$ with

**$\gcd(a, b,

Problem 277
===========

A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting
value $a\_1$ in the following way:

$a\_{n+1} = \, \,\, \frac {a\_n} 3 \quad$ if $a\_n$ is
divisible by $3$. We shall denote this as a large downward step,
\"D\".

$a\_{n+1} = \frac {4 a\_n+2} 3 \, \,$ if $a\_n$ divided by $3$
gives a remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step,
\"U\".

$a\_{n+1} = \frac {2 a\_n -1} 3 \, \,$ if $a\_n$ divided by $3$
gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward
step, \"d\".

The sequence terminates when some $a\_n = 1$.

Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
For instance if $a\_1=231$, then the sequence
$\{a\_n\}=\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\}$ corresponds to the
steps \"DdDddUUdDD\".

Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence
\"DdDddUUdDD\....\".
For instance, if $a\_1=1004064$, then the sequence is
DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
In fact, $1004064$ is the smallest possible $a\_1 \> 10^6$ that
begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.

What is the smallest $a\_1 \> 10^{15}$ that begins with the sequence
\"UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd\"?

Problem 278

Given the values of integers $1 \< a\_1 \< a\_2 \< \dots \< a\_n$,
consider the linear combination
$q\_1 a\_1+q\_2 a\_2 + \dots + q\_n a\_n=b$, using only integer
values $q\_k \ge 0$.

Note that for a given set of $a\_k$, it may be that not all values of
$b$ are possible.
For instance, if $a\_1=5$ and $a\_2=7$, there are no $q\_1 \ge 0$
and $q\_2 \ge 0$ such that $b$ could be
$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18$ or $23$.
In fact, $23$ is the largest impossible value of $b$ for $a\_1=5$
and $a\_2=7$.
We therefore call $f(5, 7) = 23$.
Similarly, it can be shown that $f(6, 10, 15)=29$ and $f(14, 22, 77)
= 195$.

A laborious ant walks randomly on a $5 \times 5$ grid. The walk
starts from the central square. At each step, the ant moves to an
adjacent square at random, without leaving the grid; thus there are
$2$, $3$ or $4$ possible moves at each step depending on the
ant\'s position.

At the start of the walk, a seed is placed on each square of the lower
row. When the ant isn\'t carrying a seed and reaches a square of the
lower row containing a seed, it will start to carry the seed. The ant
will drop the seed on the first empty square of the upper row it
eventually reaches.

What\'s the expected number of steps until all seeds have been dropped
in the top row?

The 3-digit number 376 in the decimal numbering system is an example of
numbers with the special property that its square ends with the same
digits: 376^2^ = 141376. Let\'s call a number with this property a
steady square.

Steady squares can also be observed in other numbering systems. In the
base 14 numbering system, the 3-digit number c37 is also a steady
square: c37^2^ = aa0c37, and the sum of its digits is c+3+7=18 in the
same numbering system. The letters a, b, c and d are used for the 10,
11, 12 and 13 digits respectively, in a manner similar to the

Problem 285

Albert chooses a positive integer $k$, then two real numbers $a, b$
are randomly chosen in the interval $\[0,1\]$ with uniform
distribution.
The square root of the sum $(k \cdot a + 1)^2 + (k \cdot b + 1)^2$
is then computed and rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is
equal to $k$, he scores $k$ points; otherwise he scores nothing.

For example, if $k = 6$, $a = 0.2$ and $b = 0.85$, then $(k
\cdot a + 1)^2 + (k \cdot b + 1)^2 = 42.05$.
The square root of $42.05$ is $6.484\cdots$ and when rounded to the
nearest integer, it becomes $6$.
This is equal to $k$, so he scores $6$ points.

It can be shown that if he plays $10$ turns with $k = 1, k = 2,
\dots, k = 10$, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five
decimal places, is $10.20914$.

The quadtree encoding allows us to describe a $2^N \times 2^N$

are to be read from left to right like this:

-   the first bit deals with the complete $2^N \times 2^N$ region;
-   \"0\" denotes a split:
    the current $2^n \times 2^n$ region is divided into $4$
    sub-regions of dimension $2^{n - 1} \times 2^{n - 1}$,
    the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right,
    bottom left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;
-   \"10\" indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;
-   \"11\" indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.

Many such paths are possible on $E(m, n)$, but we are only interested

An even positive integer $N$ will be called admissible, if it is a
power of $2$ or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.
The first twelve admissible numbers are
$2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48$.

If $N$ is admissible, the smallest integer $M \gt 1$ such that
$N+M$ is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for $N$.

For example, $N=630$ is admissible since it is even and its distinct
prime factors are the consecutive primes $2,3,5$ and $7$.
The next prime number after $631$ is $641$; hence, the

Problem 297
===========

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms.
Starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be: $1, 2,
3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89$.

Every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of
nonconsecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, $100 = 3 +
8 + 89$.
Such a sum is called the **Zeckendorf representation** of the number.

For any integer $n \gt 0$, let $z(n)$ be the number of terms in the
Zeckendorf representation of $n$.
Thus, $z(5) = 1$, $z(14) = 2$, $z(100) = 3$ etc.
Also, for $0 \lt n \lt 10^6$, $\sum z(n) = 7894453$.

Problem 298

Larry and Robin play a memory game involving a sequence of random
numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time.
Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called
number is in a player\'s memory, that player is awarded a point. If
it\'s not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing
another number if his memory is full.

Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new
missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding
which number to remove:
Larry\'s strategy is to remove the number that hasn\'t been called in
the longest time.
Robin\'s strategy is to remove the number that\'s been in the memory the
longest time.

It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if $a
= c$.

So, given that $a = c$, we are looking for triplets $(a, b, d)$ such
that at least one point $P$ (with integer coordinates) exists on
$AC$, making the three triangles $ABP$, $CDP$ and $BDP$ all
similar.

For example, if $(a, b, d)=(2,3,4)$, it can be easily verified that
point $P(1,1)$ satisfies the above condition. Note that the triplets
$(2,3,4)$ and $(2,4,3)$ are considered as distinct, although point
$P(1,1)$ is common for both.

If $b + d \lt 100$, there are $92$ distinct triplets $(a, b, d)$
such that point $P$ exists.
If $b + d \lt 100\,000$, there are $320471$ distinct triplets
$(a, b, d)$ such that point $P$ exists.

If $b + d \lt 100\,000\,000$, how many distinct triplets $(a, b,
d)$ are there such that point $P$ exists?

Problem 300
===========

In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings
consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g.
HHPPHHHPHHPH.
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is
considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are $2^n$ distinct proteins
consisting of $n$ elements.

When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in
such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as
possible, since this is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with
the P-elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will
only consider protein folding in [two dimensions]{.underline}.

The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could
be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).

::: {align="center"}
![0300\_protein.gif](resources/images/0300_protein.gif?1678992056)
:::

The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would
never occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points,
which is optimal for this string.

Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any
position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in
an optimal folding of a random protein string of length $8$ turns out
to be $850 / 2^8 = 3.3203125$.

What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding
of a random protein string of length $15$?
Give your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact

Problem 301
===========

[Nim]{.dfn} is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players
take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no
stones remain.

We\'ll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works
as follows:

-   At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
-   On each player\'s turn, the player may remove any positive number of
    stones from any single heap.
-   The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.

If $(n\_1,n\_2,n\_3)$ indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of
size $n\_1$, $n\_2$, and $n\_3$, then there is a simple function,
which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself,
$X(n\_1,n\_2,n\_3)$ that returns:

-   zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
    eventually lose; or
-   non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will
    eventually win.

For example $X(1,2,3) = 0$ because, no matter what the current player
does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of
equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be
mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player
loses. To illustrate:

-   current player moves to $(1,2,1)$
-   opponent moves to $(1,0,1)$
-   current player moves to $(0,0,1)$
-   opponent moves to $(0,0,0)$, and so wins.

For how many positive integers $n \le 2^{30}$ does $X(n,2n,3n) =
0$ ?

Problem 302
===========

A positive integer $n$ is **powerful** if $p^2$ is a divisor of
$n$ for every prime factor $p$ in $n$.

A positive integer $n$ is a **perfect power** if $n$ can be
expressed as a power of another positive integer.

A positive integer $n$ is an **Achilles number** if $n$ is powerful
but not a perfect power. For example, $864$ and $1800$ are Achilles
numbers: $864 = 2^5 \cdot 3^3$ and $1800 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot
5^2$.

We shall call a positive integer $S$ a [Strong Achilles number]{.dfn}
if both $S$ and $\phi(S)$ are Achilles numbers.^1^
For example, $864$ is a Strong Achilles number: $\phi(864) = 288 =
2^5 \cdot 3^2$. However, $1800$ isn\'t a Strong Achilles number
because: $\phi(1800) = 480 = 2^5 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1$.

There are $7$ Strong Achilles numbers below $10^4$ and $656$
below $10^8$.

How many Strong Achilles numbers are there below $10^{18}$?

^1^ $\phi$ denotes **Euler\'s totient function**.

The Fibonacci sequence $f(n)$ is defined by: $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$
and $f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)$ for $n \gt 1$.

The sequence $b(n)$ is defined as $f(a(n))$.

It\'s easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of
times in $S$.

Let\'s call $f(n)$ the starting position of the $n$^th^ occurrence
of $n$ in $S$.
For example, $f(1)=1$, $f(5)=81$, $f(12)=271$ and
$f(7780)=111111365$.

Problem 306
===========

The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:

Two players start with a strip of $n$ white squares and they take
alternate turns.
On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints
them black.
The first player who cannot make a move loses.

-   $n = 1$: No valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.
-   $n = 2$: Only one valid move, after which the second player loses.
-   $n = 3$: Two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the
    second player loses.
-   $n = 4$: Three valid moves for the first player, who is able to
    win the game by painting the two middle squares.
-   $n = 5$: Four valid moves for the first player (shown below in
    red), but no matter what the player does, the second player (blue)
    wins.

So, for $1 \le n \le 5$, there are 3 values of $n$ for which the
first player can force a win.
Similarly, for $1 \le n \le 50$, there are 40 values of $n$ for
which the first player can force a win.

Problem 308
===========

A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a
list of fractions.

The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive
integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a
Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in
the list which will leave it an integer.

For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote
for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:

$$\dfrac{17}{91}, \dfrac{78}{85}, \dfrac{19}{51}, \dfrac{23}{38},
\dfrac{29}{33}, \dfrac{77}{29}, \dfrac{95}{23}, \dfrac{77}{19},
\dfrac{1}{17}, \dfrac{11}{13}, \dfrac{13}{11}, \dfrac{15}{2},
\dfrac{1}{7}, \dfrac{55}{1}$$

Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program
produce the sequence:
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, \..., 68, **4**, 30, \..., 136, **8**,
60, \..., 544, **32**, 240, \...

The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 2^2^, 2^3^, 2^5^, \...
It can be shown that *all* the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime
exponents and that *all* the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2,
in proper order!

If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler
Problem 7 (find the 10001^st^ prime), how many iterations would be
needed until the program produces 2^10001st\ prime^ ?

Problem 314
===========

The moon has been opened up, and land can be obtained for free, but
there is a catch. You have to build a wall around the land that you
stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country
has been allotted a $\pu{500 m}$ by $\pu{500 m}$ square area, but
they will possess only that area which they wall in. $251001$ posts
have been placed in a rectangular grid with $1$ meter spacing. The
wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from
post to post.

The bigger countries of course have built a $\pu{2000 m}$ wall
enclosing the entire $\pu{250 000 m^2}$ area. The [Duchy of Grand
Fenwick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Fenwick), has a tighter
budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape
would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.

You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper. For a
$2000$ meter wall enclosing the $\pu{250 000 m^2}$ area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is $125$.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better: if
you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the
area will be equal to $\pi \times \pu{250^2 m^2}$ and the
perimeter will be $\pi \times \pu{500 m}$, so the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be $125$.

However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides
$\pu{75 m}$, $\pu{75 m}$ and $75\pu{\sqrt 2 m}$ the total area
becomes $\pu{238750 m^2}$ and the perimeter becomes
$1400+300\pu{\sqrt 2 m}$. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length
ratio of $130.87$, which is significantly better.

:::

Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two \"digital
root\" clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots
step by step.

When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the
calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the
result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show:
\"**137**\" → \"**11**\" → \"**2**\" and then it will go black, waiting
for the next number.

Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal
(top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right,
bottom-left, bottom-right).
Number \"**1**\" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number
\"**4**\" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right
and bottom-right. Number \"**8**\" lights them all.

The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a \"**2**\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"**7**\" will
cost only 4 transitions.

Sam and Max built two different clocks.

Sam\'s clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"**137**\", then
the panel is turned off, then the next number (\"**11**\") is turned on,
then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number
(\"**2**\") is turned on and, after some time, off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam\'s clock requires:

  ------------- --- --------------------------------------------------------

Max\'s clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel,
it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won\'t be needed
for the next number.
For number 137, Max\'s clock requires:

Problem 316
===========

Let $p = p\_1 p\_2 p\_3 \cdots$ be an infinite sequence of random
digits, selected from $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with equal
probability.
It can be seen that $p$ corresponds to the real number $0.p\_1 p\_2
p\_3 \cdots$
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval
$\[0,1)$ is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random
digits selected from $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with equal
probability.

For any positive integer $n$ with $d$ decimal digits, let $k$ be
the smallest index such that $p\_k, p\_{k + 1}, \dots, p\_{k + d -
1}$ are the decimal digits of $n$, in the same order.
Also, let $g(n)$ be the expected value of $k$; it can be proven that
$g(n)$ is always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.

For example, if $n = 535$, then
for $p = 31415926\mathbf{535}897\cdots$, we get $k = 9$
for $p = 35528714365004956000049084876408468\mathbf{535}4\cdots$, we
get $k = 36$
etc and we find that $g(535) = 1008$.

Given that $\displaystyle\sum\_{n = 2}^{999} g
\left(\left\lfloor\frac{10^6} n \right\rfloor\right) =
27280188$, find $\displaystyle\sum\_{n = 2}^{999999} g
\left(\left\lfloor\frac{10^{16}} n \right\rfloor\right)$.

[*Note*]{.underline}: $\lfloor x \rfloor$ represents the floor
function.

Problem 317
===========

A firecracker explodes at a height of $\pu{100 m}$ above level
ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which
move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of
$\pu{20 m/s}$.

We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform
gravitational field with $g=\pu{9.81 m/s^2}$.

Find the volume (in $\pu{m^3}$) of the region through which the
fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to
four decimal places.

Problem 318
===========

Consider the real number $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3$.
When we calculate the even powers of $\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3$ we get:
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^2 = 9.898979485566356 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^4 = 97.98979485566356 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^6 = 969.998969071069263 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^8 = 9601.99989585502907 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{10} = 95049.999989479221 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{12} = 940897.9999989371855 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{14} = 9313929.99999989263 \cdots $
$(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^{16} = 92198401.99999998915 \cdots $

It looks as if the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the
fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.
In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of $(\sqrt 2 +
\sqrt 3)^{2 n}$ approaches $1$ for large $n$.

Consider all real numbers of the form $\sqrt p + \sqrt q$ with $p$
and $q$ positive integers and $p \< q$, such that the fractional
part of $(\sqrt p + \sqrt q)^{ 2 n}$ approaches $1$ for large
$n$.

Let $C(p,q,n)$ be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of
the fractional part of $(\sqrt p + \sqrt q)^{ 2 n}$.

Let $N(p,q)$ be the minimal value of $n$ such that $C(p,q,n) \ge
2011$.

Find $\displaystyle \sum N(p,q) \,\, \text{ for } p+q \le 2011$.

Problem 319

Let $x\_1, x\_2, \dots, x\_n$ be a sequence of length $n$ such
that:

-   $x\_1 = 2$
-   for all $1 \lt i \le n$: $x\_{i - 1} \lt x\_i$
-   for all $i$ and $j$ with $1 \le i, j \le n$: $(x\_i)^j
    \lt (x\_j + 1)^i$.

There are only five such sequences of length $2$, namely:
$\{2,4\}$, $\{2,5\}$, $\{2,6\}$, $\{2,7\}$ and
$\{2,8\}$.
There are $293$ such sequences of length $5$; three examples are
given below:
$\{2,5,11,25,55\}$, $\{2,6,14,36,88\}$, $\{2,8,22,64,181\}$.

Let $t(n)$ denote the number of such sequences of length $n$.
You are given that $t(10) = 86195$ and $t(20) = 5227991891$.

Find $t(10^{10})$ and give your answer modulo $10^9$.

$S(1000)=614538266565663$.

Find $S(1\,000\,000) \bmod 10^{18}$.

Problem 321
===========

A horizontal row comprising of $2n + 1$ squares has $n$ red counters
placed at one end and $n$ blue counters at the other end, being
separated by a single empty square in the centre. For example, when $n
= 3$.

::: {align="center"}

A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over
another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is
unoccupied.

Let $M(n)$ represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely
reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the
red counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.

It can be verified $M(3) = 15$, which also happens to be a triangle
number.

If we create a sequence based on the values of $n$ for which $M(n)$
is a triangle number then the first five terms would be:
$1$, $3$, $10$, $22$, and $63$, and their sum would be $99$.

Find the sum of the first forty terms of this sequence.

Problem 322
===========

Let $T(m, n)$ be the number of the binomial coefficients $^iC\_n$
that are divisible by $10$ for $n \le i \lt m$ ($i$, $m$ and
$n$ are positive integers).
You are given that $T(10^9, 10^7-10) = 989697000$.

Find $T(10^{18}, 10^{12}-10)$.

Problem 323
===========

Let $y\_0, y\_1, y\_2, \dots$ be a sequence of random unsigned
$32$-bit integers
(i.e. $0 \le y\_i \lt 2^{32}$, every value equally likely).

For the sequence $x\_i$ the following recursion is given:

-   $x\_0 = 0$ and
-   $x\_i = x\_{i - 1} \boldsymbol \mid y\_{i - 1}$, for $i \gt
    0$. ($\boldsymbol \mid$ is the bitwise-OR operator).

It can be seen that eventually there will be an index $N$ such that
$x\_i = 2^{32} - 1$ (a bit-pattern of all ones) for all $i \ge N$.

Find the expected value of $N$.
Give your answer rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.

Problem 324
===========

Let $f(n)$ represent the number of ways one can fill a $3 \times 3
\times n$ tower with blocks of $2 \times 1 \times 1$.
You\'re allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however,
rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.

For example (with $q = 100000007$):
$f(2) = 229$,
$f(4) = 117805$,
$f(10) \bmod q = 96149360$,
$f(10^3) \bmod q = 24806056$,
$f(10^6) \bmod q = 30808124$.

Find $f(10^{10000}) \bmod 100000007$.

Problem 325
===========

A game is played with two piles of stones and two players.
On each player\'s turn, the player may remove a number of stones from
the larger pile.
The number of stones removed must be a positive multiple of the number
of stones in the smaller pile.

E.g. Let the ordered pair $(6,14)$ describe a configuration with $6$
stones in the smaller pile and $14$ stones in the larger pile, then
the first player can remove $6$ or $12$ stones from the larger pile.

The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.

A [winning configuration]{.dfn} is one where the first player can force
a win. For example, $(1,5)$, $(2,6)$, and $(3,12)$ are winning
configurations because the first player can immediately remove all
stones in the second pile.

A [losing configuration]{.dfn} is one where the second player can force
a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, $(2,3)$ and
$(3,4)$ are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning
configuration for the second player.

Define $S(N)$ as the sum of $(x\_i + y\_i)$ for all losing
configurations $(x\_i, y\_i), 0 \lt x\_i \lt y\_i \le N$.
We can verify that $S(10) = 211$ and $S(10^4) = 230312207313$.

Find $S(10^{16}) \bmod 7^{10}$.

Problem 326
===========

Let $a\_n$ be a sequence recursively defined by:$\quad
a\_1=1,\quad\displaystyle a\_n=\biggl(\sum\_{k=1}^{n-1}k\cdot
a\_k\biggr)\bmod n$.

So the first $10$ elements of $a\_n$ are: $1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9$.

Let $f(N, M)$ represent the number of pairs $(p, q)$ such that:

$$ \def\htmltext\#1{\style{font-family:inherit;}{\text{\#1}}}
1\le p\le q\le N
\quad\htmltext{and}\quad\biggl(\sum\_{i=p}^qa\_i\biggr)\bmod M=0
$$

It can be seen that $f(10,10)=4$ with the pairs $(3,3)$, $(5,5)$,
$(7,9)$ and $(9,10)$.

You are also given that $f(10^4,10^3)=97158$.

Find $f(10^{12},10^6)$.

Problem 327
===========

A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.

::: {align="center"}
![0327\_rooms\_of\_doom.gif](resources/images/0327_rooms_of_doom.gif?1678992056)
:::

Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door
automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A
machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but
each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they
detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they
detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will
become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you
may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.

If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as
you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be
trapped in that room forever!

However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible.
For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one
card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back
to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing
machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you
placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will
be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows
you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.

It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of $123$
security cards while carrying a maximum of $3$ cards.

Let $C$ be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any
time.

Let $R$ be the number of rooms to travel through.

Let $M(C,R)$ be the minimum number of cards required from the
dispensing machine to travel through $R$ rooms carrying up to a
maximum of $C$ cards at any time.

For example, $M(3,6)=123$ and $M(4,6)=23$.
And, $\sum M(C, 6) = 146$ for $3 \le C \le 4$.

You are given that $\sum M(C,10)=10382$ for $3 \le C \le 10$.

Find $\sum M(C,30)$ for $3 \le C \le 40$.

Problem 328
===========

We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
$\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ by asking questions. Each number (question) we
ask, has a [cost equal to the number asked]{.underline} and we get one
of three possible answers:

-   \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\", or
-   \"Yes, that\'s it!\", or
-   \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\".

Given the value of $n$, an [optimal strategy]{.dfn} minimizes the
total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) [for the worst
possible case]{.underline}. E.g.

If $n=3$, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \"**2**\".
The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a
total cost $= 2$).

If $n=8$, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy:
Our first question would be \"$\mathbf 4$\" and if the hidden number
is higher than $4$ we will need one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be \"$\mathbf 6$\". If the hidden number is
still higher than $6$, we will need a third question in order to
discriminate between $7$ and $8$.
Thus, our third question will be \"$\mathbf 7$\" and the total cost
for this worst-case scenario will be
$4+6+7={\color{red}\mathbf{17}}$.

We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for $n=8$, by asking
\"$\mathbf 5$\" as our first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than $5$, our second
question will be \"$\mathbf 7$\", then we\'ll know for certain what
the hidden number is (for a total cost of
$5+7={\color{blue}\mathbf{12}}$).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than $5$, our second
question will be \"$\mathbf 3$\" and if the hidden number is lower
than $3$ our third question will be \"$\mathbf 1$\", giving a total
cost of $5+3+1={\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$.
Since ${\color{blue}\mathbf{12}} \gt {\color{blue}\mathbf 9}$,
the worst-case cost for this strategy is ${\color{red}\mathbf{12}}$.
That\'s better than what we achieved previously with the \"binary
search\" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other
strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for $n=8$.

Let $C(n)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for
$n$, as described above.
Thus $C(1) = 0$, $C(2) = 1$, $C(3) = 2$ and $C(8) = 12$.
Similarly, $C(100) = 400$ and $\sum \limits\_{n = 1}^{100} C(n) =
17575$.

Find $\sum \limits\_{n = 1}^{200000} C(n)$.

Problem 329
===========

Susan has a prime frog.
Her frog is jumping around over $500$ squares numbered $1$ to
$500$. He can only jump one square to the left or to the right, with
equal probability, and he cannot jump outside the range $\[1;500\]$.
(if it lands at either end, it automatically jumps to the only available
square on the next move.)

When he is on a square with a prime number on it, he croaks \'P\'
(PRIME) with probability $2/3$ or \'N\' (NOT PRIME) with probability
$1/3$ just before jumping to the next square.
When he is on a square with a number on it that is not a prime he croaks
\'P\' with probability $1/3$ or \'N\' with probability $2/3$ just
before jumping to the next square.

Given that the frog\'s starting position is random with the same
probability for every square, and given that she listens to his first
$15$ croaks, what is the probability that she hears the sequence
PPPPNNPPPNPPNPN?

Give your answer as a fraction $p/q$ in reduced form.

Problem 330
===========

An infinite sequence of real numbers $a(n)$ is defined for all
integers $n$ as follows: $$a(n) = \begin{cases} 1 & n \lt 0\
\sum \limits\_{i = 1}^{\infty}{\dfrac{a(n - i)}{i!}} & n \ge 0
\end{cases}$$

For example,

$a(0) = \dfrac{1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots = e
- 1$
$a(1) = \dfrac{e - 1}{1!} + \dfrac{1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} + \cdots
= 2e - 3$
$a(2) = \dfrac{2e - 3}{1!} + \dfrac{e - 1}{2!} + \dfrac{1}{3!} +
\cdots = \dfrac{7}{2}e - 6$

with $e = 2.7182818\...$ being Euler\'s constant.

It can be shown that $a(n)$ is of the form $\dfrac{A(n)e +
B(n)}{n!}$ for integers $A(n)$ and $B(n)$.

For example, $a(10) = \dfrac{328161643e - 652694486}{10!}$.

Find $A(10^9) + B(10^9)$ and give your answer mod

Problem 333
===========

All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and
every term of the partition can be expressed as $2^i \times 3^j$,
where $i,j \ge 0$.

Let\'s consider only such partitions where none of the terms can divide
any of the other terms.
For example, the partition of $17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2^1 \times 3^0 +
2^1 \times 3^1 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$ would not be valid since $2$
can divide $6$. Neither would the partition $17 = 16 + 1 = (2^4
\times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^0)$ since $1$ can divide $16$. The
only valid partition of $17$ would be $8 + 9 = (2^3 \times 3^0 +
2^0 \times 3^2)$.

Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being $11$
having the following two partitions.
$11 = 2 + 9 = (2^1 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^2)$
$11 = 8 + 3 = (2^3 \times 3^0 + 2^0 \times 3^1)$

Let\'s define $P(n)$ as the number of valid partitions of $n$. For
example, $P(11) = 2$.

Let\'s consider only the prime integers $q$ which would have a single
valid partition such as $P(17)$.

The sum of the primes $q \lt 100$ such that $P(q)=1$ equals
$233$.

Find the sum of the primes $q \lt 1000000$ such that $P(q)=1$.

Problem 334
===========

In Plato\'s heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a
straight line.
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two
beans from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.
The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.

For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing $2$ and $3$
beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight
moves will finish the game:

::: {align="center"}

You are given the following sequences:

$\def\htmltext\#1{\style{font-family:inherit;}{\text{\#1}}}$ $
\begin{align} \qquad t\_0 &= 123456,\cr \qquad t\_i &= \cases{
\;\;\frac{t\_{i-1}}{2},&$\htmltext{if }t\_{i-1}\htmltext{ is

function }\cr &\qquad\!\htmltext{and }\oplus\htmltext{is the
bitwise XOR operator.}\cr \qquad b\_i &= (t\_i\bmod2^{11}) + 1.\cr
\end{align} $

The first two terms of the last sequence are $b\_1 = 289$ and $b\_2 =
145$.
If we start with $b\_1$ and $b\_2$ beans in two adjacent bowls,
$3419100$ moves would be required to finish the game.

Consider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing $b\_1, b\_2, \ldots,
b\_{1500}$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how
many moves it takes before the game ends.

Problem 335
===========

Whenever Peter feels bored, he places some bowls, containing one bean
each, in a circle. After this, he takes all the beans out of a certain
bowl and drops them one by one in the bowls going clockwise. He repeats
this, starting from the bowl he dropped the last bean in, until the
initial situation appears again. For example with 5 bowls he acts as
follows:

So with $5$ bowls it takes Peter $15$ moves to return to the initial
situation.

Let $M(x)$ represent the number of moves required to return to the
initial situation, starting with $x$ bowls. Thus, $M(5) = 15$. It
can also be verified that $M(100) = 10920$.

Problem 336
===========

A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However,
sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not
in the correct order.
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating
turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the
train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with
it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the
carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as
necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are
separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order
has been achieved.

However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his
efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting
carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.

Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which
we shall call *maximix arrangements*, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring
him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they
could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for
DACB is shown below.

For any positive integer $k$, a finite sequence $a\_i$ of fractions

One variant of N.G. de Bruijn\'s **silver dollar** game can be described
as follows:

On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per
square. Only one coin, called the **silver dollar**, has any value. Two
players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either
a [regular]{.dfn} or a [special]{.dfn} move.

A [regular]{.dfn} move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one
or more squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or
jump on or over another coin.

Alternatively, the player can choose to make the [special]{.dfn} move of
pocketing the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no
regular moves are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost
coin.

The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.

A [list of size $n$]{.dfn} is a sequence of $n$ natural numbers.
Examples are $(2,4,6)$, $(2,6,4)$, $(10,6,15,6)$, and $(11)$.

The **greatest common divisor**, or $\gcd$, of a list is the largest
natural number that divides all entries of the list.
Examples: $\gcd(2,6,4) = 2$, $\gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1$ and $\gcd(11)

The **least common multiple**, or $\operatorname{lcm}$, of a list is

Problem 352
===========

Each one of the $25$ sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus,
known to affect $2\%$ of the sheep population. An accurate and
extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear
positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.

Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of
performing $25$ separate tests, the following procedure can be used
instead:

The sheep are split into $5$ groups of $5$ sheep in each group. For
each group, the $5$ samples are mixed together and a single test is
performed. Then,

-   If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to
    be virus-free.
-   If the result is positive, $5$ additional tests will be performed
    (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected
    individual(s).

Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only
$0.02$, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:

-   Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability $0.98^5 =
    0.9039207968$.
-   Positive ($5$ additional tests needed) with probability $1 -
    0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032$.

Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is $1 + 0.0960792032
\times 5 = 1.480396016$.
Consequently, all $5$ groups can be screened using an average of only
$1.480396016 \times 5 = \mathbf{7.40198008}$ tests, which represents
a huge saving of more than $70\%$!

Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient,
it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is
sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by
mixing different samples). E.g.:

-   We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the $25$
    samples. It can be verified that in about $60.35\%$ of the cases
    this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed.
    Further testing will only be required for the remaining $39.65\%$
    of the cases.
-   If we know that at least one animal in a group of $5$ is infected
    and the first $4$ individual tests come out negative, there is no
    need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be
    infected).
-   We can try a different number of groups / different number of
    animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that
    the total expected number of tests will be minimised.

To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one
restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing
scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep
contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of
infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start
examining any other animals.

For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient
testing scheme (we\'ll call it the [optimal strategy]{.dfn}) requires an
average of just $\mathbf{4.155452}$ tests!

Using the optimal strategy, let $T(s,p)$ represent the average number
of tests needed to screen a flock of $s$ sheep for a virus having
probability $p$ to be present in any individual.
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, $T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452$ and
$T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124$.

Find $\sum T(10000, p)$ for $p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, \dots 0.50$.
Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

Problem 353

A moon could be described by the sphere $C(r)$ with centre $(0,0,0)$
and radius $r$.

There are stations on the moon at the points on the surface of $C(r)$
with integer coordinates. The station at $(0,0,r)$ is called North
Pole station, the station at $(0,0,-r)$ is called South Pole station.

All stations are connected with each other via the shortest road on the
great arc through the stations. A journey between two stations is risky.
If `d`{.variable} is the length of the road between two stations,
$\left(\frac{d}{\pi r}\right)^2$ is a measure for the risk of the
journey (let us call it the risk of the road). If the journey includes
more than two stations, the risk of the journey is the sum of risks of
the used roads.

A direct journey from the North Pole station to the South Pole station
has the length $\pi r$ and risk $1$. The journey from the North

For a positive real number $L$, let $\text{B}(L)$ count the cells
with distance $L$ from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured
from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large
enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider.

Problem 358
===========

A **cyclic number** with $n$ digits has a very interesting property:
When it is multiplied by $1, 2, 3, 4, \dots, n$, all the products
have exactly the same digits, in the same order, but rotated in a
circular fashion!

The smallest cyclic number is the $6$-digit number $142857$:
$142857 \times 1 = 142857$
$142857 \times 2 = 285714$
$142857 \times 3 = 428571$
$142857 \times 4 = 571428$
$142857 \times 5 = 714285$
$142857 \times 6 = 857142$

The next cyclic number is $0588235294117647$ with $16$ digits :
$0588235294117647 \times 1 = 0588235294117647$
$0588235294117647 \times 2 = 1176470588235294$
$0588235294117647 \times 3 = 1764705882352941$
$\dots$
$0588235294117647 \times 16 = 9411764705882352$

Note that for cyclic numbers, leading zeros are important.

There is only one cyclic number for which, the eleven leftmost digits
are $00000000137$ and the five rightmost digits are $56789$ (i.e.,
it has the form $00000000137 \cdots 56789$ with an unknown number of

Problem 359
===========

An infinite number of people (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.) are
lined up to get a room at Hilbert\'s newest infinite hotel. The hotel
contains an infinite number of floors (numbered $1$, $2$, $3$,
etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered
$1$, $2$, $3$, etc.).

Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the
$n$^th^ person is assigned a room: person $n$ gets the first vacant
room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:

-   the floor is empty
-   the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in
    that floor is person $m$, then $m + n$ is a perfect square

Person $1$ gets room $1$ in floor $1$ since floor $1$ is empty.
Person $2$ does not get room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 2 = 3$
is not a perfect square.
Person $2$ instead gets room $1$ in floor $2$ since floor $2$ is
empty.
Person $3$ gets room $2$ in floor $1$ since $1 + 3 = 4$ is a
perfect square.

Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.

Define $P(f, r)$ to be $n$ if person $n$ occupies room $r$ in
floor $f$, and $0$ if no person occupies the room. Here are a few
examples:
$P(1, 1) = 1$
$P(1, 2) = 3$
$P(2, 1) = 2$
$P(10, 20) = 440$
$P(25, 75) = 4863$
$P(99, 100) = 19454$

Find the sum of all $P(f, r)$ for all positive $f$ and $r$ such
that $f \times r = 71328803586048$ and give the last $8$ digits as
your answer.

Problem 360

Given two points $(x\_1, y\_1, z\_1)$ and $(x\_2, y\_2, z\_2)$ in
three dimensional space, the **Manhattan distance** between those points
is defined as
$\|x\_1 - x\_2\| + \|y\_1 - y\_2\| + \|z\_1 - z\_2\|$.

Let $C(r)$ be a sphere with radius $r$ and center in the origin
$O(0,0,0)$.
Let $I(r)$ be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the
surface of $C(r)$.
Let $S(r)$ be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of
$I(r)$ to the origin $O$.

Problem 361
===========

The **Thue-Morse sequence** $\{T\_n\}$ is a binary sequence
satisfying:

-   $T\_0 = 0$
-   $T\_{2n} = T\_n$
-   $T\_{2n + 1} = 1 - T\_n$

The first several terms of $\{T\_n\}$ are given as follows:
$01101001{\color{red}10010}1101001011001101001\cdots$

We define $\{A\_n\}$ as the sorted sequence of integers such that
the binary expression of each element appears as a subsequence in
$\{T\_n\}$.
For example, the decimal number $18$ is expressed as $10010$ in
binary. $10010$ appears in $\{T\_n\}$ ($T\_8$ to $T\_{12}$),
so $18$ is an element of $\{A\_n\}$.
The decimal number $14$ is expressed as $1110$ in binary. $1110$
never appears in $\{T\_n\}$, so $14$ is not an element of
$\{A\_n\}$.

The first several terms of $\{A\_n\}$ are given as follows:

  ---------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------------
    $n$      $0$   $1$   $2$   $3$   $4$   $5$   $6$   $7$    $8$    $9$   $10$   $11$   $12$   $\cdots$
   $A\_n$    $0$   $1$   $2$   $3$   $4$   $5$   $6$   $9$   $10$   $11$   $12$   $13$   $18$   $\cdots$
  ---------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------------

We can also verify that $A\_{100} = 3251$ and $A\_{1000} =
80852364498$.

Problem 362
===========

Consider the number $54$.
$54$ can be factored in $7$ distinct ways into one or more factors
larger than $1$:
$54$, $2 \times 27$, $3 \times 18$, $6 \times 9$, $3 \times
3 \times 6$, $2 \times 3 \times 9$ and $2 \times 3 \times 3
\times 3$.
If we require that the factors are all squarefree only two ways remain:
$3 \times 3 \times 6$ and $2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$.

Let\'s call $\operatorname{Fsf}(n)$ the number of ways $n$ can be
factored into one or more squarefree factors larger than $1$, so
$\operatorname{Fsf}(54)=2$.

Let $S(n)$ be $\sum \operatorname{Fsf}(k)$ for $k=2$ to $n$.

$S(100)=193$.

Find $S(10\,000\,000\,000)$.

Problem 363

A cubic Bézier curve is defined by four points: $P\_0, P\_1, P\_2,$
and $P\_3$.

::: {.float_right}
![p363\_bezier.png](project/images/p363_bezier.png){.dark_img}
:::

The curve is constructed as follows:

On the segments $P\_0 P\_1$, $P\_1 P\_2$, and $P\_2 P\_3$ the
points $Q\_0, Q\_1,$ and $Q\_2$ are drawn such that $\dfrac{P\_0
Q\_0}{P\_0 P\_1} = \dfrac{P\_1 Q\_1}{P\_1 P\_2} = \dfrac{P\_2
Q\_2}{P\_2 P\_3} = t$, with $t$ in $\[0, 1\]$.

On the segments $Q\_0 Q\_1$ and $Q\_1 Q\_2$ the points $R\_0$ and
$R\_1$ are drawn such that
$\dfrac{Q\_0 R\_0}{Q\_0 Q\_1} = \dfrac{Q\_1 R\_1}{Q\_1 Q\_2} = t$
for the same value of $t$.

On the segment $R\_0 R\_1$ the point $B$ is drawn such that
$\dfrac{R\_0 B}{R\_0 R\_1} = t$ for the same value of $t$.

The Bézier curve defined by the points $P\_0, P\_1, P\_2, P\_3$ is the
locus of $B$ as $Q\_0$ takes all possible positions on the segment
$P\_0 P\_1$.
(Please note that for all points the value of $t$ is the same.)

From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent
to the segments $P\_0 P\_1$ in $P\_0$ and $P\_2 P\_3$ in $P\_3$.

A cubic Bézier curve with $P\_0 = (1, 0), P\_1 = (1, v), P\_2 = (v,
1),$ and $P\_3 = (0, 1)$ is used to approximate a quarter circle.
The value $v \gt 0$ is chosen such that the area enclosed by the
lines $O P\_0, OP\_3$ and the curve is equal to $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$
(the area of the quarter circle).

By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length
of the quarter circle?
That is, if $L$ is the length of the curve, calculate $100 \times
\dfrac{L - \frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{\pi}{2}}$
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.

There are $N$ seats in a row. $N$ people come after each other to
fill the seats according to the following rules:

Problem 366
===========

Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.
There is one pile of $n$ stones.
The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the
whole pile.
Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones
his opponent took on the previous move.
The player who removes the last stone wins.

E.g. $n=5$.
If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player
will be able to take all remaining stones.
If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will
take also one stone, leaving three stones.
The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most $2
\times 1=2$ stones. So let\'s say he takes also one stone, leaving
$2$. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.
So $5$ is a losing position for the first player.
For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the
first player.
E.g. when $n=17$ the first player can remove one or four stones.

Let $M(n)$ be the maximum number of stones the first player can take
from a winning position *at his first turn* and $M(n)=0$ for any other
position.

$\sum M(n)$ for $n \le 100$ is $728$.

Find $\sum M(n)$ for $n \le 10^{18}$. Give your answer modulo
$10^8$.

Problem 367

**Bozo sort**, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient
**bogo sort**, consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted
and if not swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until
eventually the sequence is sorted.

If we consider all permutations of the first $4$ natural numbers as
input the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all
$4!$ input sequences is $24.75$.
The already sorted sequence takes $0$ steps.

In this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.
If the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and
shuffle these three elements randomly.
All $3!=6$ permutations of those three elements are equally likely.
The already sorted sequence will take $0$ steps.
If we consider all permutations of the first $4$ natural numbers as
input the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all
$4!$ input sequences is $27.5$.
Consider as input sequences the permutations of the first $11$ natural
numbers.
Averaged over all $11!$ input sequences, what is the expected number
of shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?

The **harmonic series** $1 + \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 + \frac 1 4 +
\cdots$ is well known to be divergent.

If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has
a $9$ in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately
$22.9206766193$.
This modified harmonic series is called the **Kempner** series.

Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from
the harmonic series every term where the denominator has $3$ or more
equal consecutive digits. One can verify that out of the first $1200$
terms of the harmonic series, only $20$ terms will be omitted.
These $20$ omitted terms are:

$$\frac 1 {111}, \frac 1 {222}, \frac 1 {333}, \frac 1 {444},
\frac 1 {555}, \frac 1 {666}, \frac 1 {777}, \frac 1 {888}, \frac 1

Problem 374
===========

An integer partition of a number $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a
sum of positive integers.

Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are
considered the same. A partition of $n$ into **distinct parts** is a
partition of $n$ in which every part occurs at most once.

The partitions of $5$ into distinct parts are:
$5$, $4+1$ and $3+2$.

Let $f(n)$ be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition
of $n$ into distinct parts and let $m(n)$ be the number of elements
of any such partition of $n$ with that product.

So $f(5)=6$ and $m(5)=2$.

For $n=10$ the partition with the largest product is $10=2+3+5$,
which gives $f(10)=30$ and $m(10)=3$.
And their product, $f(10) \cdot m(10) = 30 \cdot 3 = 90$.

It can be verified that
$\sum f(n) \cdot m(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 100 = 1683550844462$.

Consider the following set of dice with nonstandard pips:

Die $A$: $1$ $4$ $4$ $4$ $4$ $4$
Die $B$: $2$ $2$ $2$ $5$ $5$ $5$
Die $C$: $3$ $3$ $3$ $3$ $3$ $6$

A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it.
The player who rolls the highest value wins.

If the first player picks die $A$ and the second player picks die
$B$ we get
$P(\text{second player wins}) = 7/12 \gt 1/2$.

If the first player picks die $B$ and the second player picks die
$C$ we get
$P(\text{second player wins}) = 7/12 \gt 1/2$.

If the first player picks die $C$ and the second player picks die
$A$ we get
$P(\text{second player wins}) = 25/36 \gt 1/2$.

So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick
another die and have a larger than $50\%$ chance of winning.
A set of dice having this property is called a **nontransitive set of
dice**.

We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We
will assume the following conditions:

-   There are three six-sided dice with each side having between $1$
    and $N$ pips, inclusive.
-   Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side
    on the die the pips are located.
-   The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll
    the same value neither player wins.
-   The sets of dice $\{A,B,C\}$, $\{B,C,A\}$ and
    $\{C,A,B\}$ are the same set.

For $N = 7$ we find there are $9780$ such sets.
How many are there for $N = 30$?

Problem 381
===========

For a prime $p$ let $S(p) = (\sum (p-k)!) \bmod (p)$ for $1 \le
k \le 5$.

For example, if $p=7$,
$(7-1)! + (7-2)! + (7-3)! + (7-4)! + (7-5)! = 6! + 5! + 4! + 3! + 2! =
720+120+24+6+2 = 872$.
As $872 \bmod (7) = 4$, $S(7) = 4$.

It can be verified that $\sum S(p) = 480$ for $5 \le p \lt 100$.

Find $\sum S(p)$ for $5 \le p \lt 10^8$.

Problem 382
===========

A **polygon** is a flat shape consisting of straight line segments that
are joined to form a closed chain or circuit. A polygon consists of at
least three sides and does not self-intersect.

A set $S$ of positive numbers is said to [generate a polygon]{.dfn}
$P$ if:

-   no two sides of $P$ are the same length,
-   the length of every side of $P$ is in $S$, and
-   $S$ contains no other value.

For example:
The set $\{3, 4, 5\}$ generates a polygon with sides $3$, $4$,
and $5$ (a triangle).
The set $\{6, 9, 11, 24\}$ generates a polygon with sides $6$,
$9$, $11$, and $24$ (a quadrilateral).
The sets $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and $\{2, 3, 4, 9\}$ do not generate any
polygon at all.

Consider the sequence $s$, defined as follows:

-   $s\_1 = 1$, $s\_2 = 2$, $s\_3 = 3$
-   $s\_n = s\_{n-1} + s\_{n-3}$ for $n \gt 3$.

Let $U\_n$ be the set $\{s\_1, s\_2, \dots, s\_n\}$. For example,
$U\_{10} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19, 28, 41\}$.
Let $f(n)$ be the number of subsets of $U\_n$ which generate at
least one polygon.
For example, $f(5) = 7$, $f(10) = 501$ and $f(25) = 18635853$.

Find the last $9$ digits of $f(10^{18})$.

Problem 383
===========

Let $f\_5(n)$ be the largest integer $x$ for which $5^x$ divides
$n$.
For example, $f\_5(625000) = 7$.

Let $T\_5(n)$ be the number of integers $i$ which satisfy $f\_5((2
\cdot i - 1)!) \lt 2 \cdot f\_5(i!)$ and $1 \le i \le n$.
It can be verified that $T\_5(10^3) = 68$ and $T\_5(10^9) =
2408210$.

Find $T\_5(10^{18})$.

Problem 384
===========

Define the sequence $a(n)$ as the number of adjacent pairs of ones in
the binary expansion of $n$ (possibly overlapping).
E.g.: $a(5) = a(101\_2) = 0$, $a(6) = a(110\_2) = 1$, $a(7) =
a(111\_2) = 2$.

Define the sequence $b(n) = (-1)^{a(n)}$.
This sequence is called the **Rudin-Shapiro** sequence.

Also consider the summatory sequence of $b(n)$: $s(n) = \sum
\limits\_{i = 0}^n b(i)$.

The first couple of values of these sequences are:

  ---------- ------- ------- ------- -------- ------- ------- -------- -------
    $n$      $0$   $1$   $2$    $3$   $4$   $5$    $6$   $7$
   $a(n)$    $0$   $0$   $0$    $1$   $0$   $0$    $1$   $2$
   $b(n)$    $1$   $1$   $1$   $-1$   $1$   $1$   $-1$   $1$
   $s(n)$    $1$   $2$   $3$    $2$   $3$   $4$    $3$   $4$
  ---------- ------- ------- ------- -------- ------- ------- -------- -------

The sequence $s(n)$ has the remarkable property that all elements are
positive and every positive integer $k$ occurs exactly $k$ times.

Define $g(t,c)$, with $1 \le c \le t$, as the index in $s(n)$
for which $t$ occurs for the $c$\'th time in $s(n)$.
E.g.: $g(3,3) = 6$, $g(4,2) = 7$ and $g(54321,12345) =
1220847710$.

Let $F(n)$ be the Fibonacci sequence defined by:
$F(0)=F(1)=1$ and
$F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)$ for $n \gt 1$.

Define $GF(t)=g(F(t),F(t-1))$.

Find $\sum GF(t)$ for $2 \le t \le 45$.

Problem 385
===========

For any triangle $T$ in the plane, it can be shown that there is a
unique ellipse with largest area that is completely inside $T$.

![0385\_ellipsetriangle.png](resources/images/0385_ellipsetriangle.png?1678992053)

For a given $n$, consider triangles $T$ such that:
- the vertices of $T$ have integer coordinates with absolute value
$\le n$, and
- the **foci**^1^ of the largest-area ellipse inside $T$ are
$(\sqrt{13},0)$ and $(-\sqrt{13},0)$.
Let $A(n)$ be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.

For example, if $n = 8$, there are two such triangles. Their vertices
are $(-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0)$ and $(4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0)$, and the area
of each triangle is $36$. Thus $A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72$.

It can be verified that $A(10) = 252$, $A(100) = 34632$ and
$A(1000) = 3529008$.

Find $A(1\,000\,000\,000)$.

[^1^The **foci** (plural of **focus**) of an ellipse are two points
$A$ and $B$ such that for every point $P$ on the boundary of the
ellipse, $AP + PB$ is constant.]{style="font-size:smaller;"}

Problem 386
===========

Let $n$ be an integer and $S(n)$ be the set of factors of $n$.

A subset $A$ of $S(n)$ is called an **antichain** of $S(n)$ if
$A$ contains only one element or if none of the elements of $A$
divides any of the other elements of $A$.

For example: $S(30) = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\}$.
$\{2, 5, 6\}$ is not an antichain of $S(30)$.
$\{2, 3, 5\}$ is an antichain of $S(30)$.

Let $N(n)$ be the maximum length of an antichain of $S(n)$.

Find $\sum N(n)$ for $1 \le n \le 10^8$.

Problem 387
===========

A **Harshad or Niven number** is a number that is divisible by the sum
of its digits.
$201$ is a Harshad number because it is divisible by $3$ (the sum of
its digits.)
When we truncate the last digit from $201$, we get $20$, which is a
Harshad number.
When we truncate the last digit from $20$, we get $2$, which is also
a Harshad number.
Let\'s call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last
digit, always results in a Harshad number a [right truncatable Harshad
number]{.dfn}.

Also:
$201/3=67$ which is prime.
Let\'s call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its
digits, results in a prime a [strong Harshad number]{.dfn}.

Now take the number $2011$ which is prime.
When we truncate the last digit from it we get $201$, a strong Harshad
number that is also right truncatable.
Let\'s call such primes [strong, right truncatable Harshad
primes]{.dfn}.

You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad
primes less than $10000$ is $90619$.

Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than
$10^{14}$.

You are given that $D(1\,000\,000) = 831909254469114121$.

Find $D(10^{10})$. Give as your answer the first nine digits followed

decimal places.

Problem 390
===========

Consider the triangle with sides $\sqrt 5$, $\sqrt {65}$ and
$\sqrt {68}$. It can be shown that this triangle has area $9$.

$S(n)$ is the sum of the areas of all triangles with sides
$\sqrt{1+b^2}$, $\sqrt {1+c^2}$ and $\sqrt{b^2+c^2}\,$
(for positive integers $b$ and $c$) that have an integral area not
exceeding $n$.

The example triangle has $b=2$ and $c=8$.

$S(10^6)=18018206$.

Find $S(10^{10})$.

Problem 391
===========

Let $s\_k$ be the number of 1's when writing the numbers from 0 to
$k$ in binary.
For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have $0, 1, 10, 11, 100,
101$. There are seven 1's, so $s\_5 = 7$.
The sequence $S = \{s\_k : k \ge 0\}$ starts $\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7,
9, 12, \...\}$.

A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number $n$
is chosen. A counter $c$ starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses
a number from 1 to $n$ (inclusive) and increases $c$ by that number.
The resulting value of $c$ must be a member of $S$. If there are no
more valid moves, then the player loses.

For example, with $n = 5$ and starting with $c = 0$:

Player 1 chooses 4, so $c$ becomes $0 + 4 = 4$.
Player 2 chooses 5, so $c$ becomes $4 + 5 = 9$.
Player 1 chooses 3, so $c$ becomes $9 + 3 = 12$.
etc.

Note that $c$ must always belong to $S$, and each player can
increase $c$ by at most $n$.

Let $M(n)$ be the highest number that the first player could choose at
the start to force a win, and $M(n) = 0$ if there is no such move. For
example, $M(2) = 2$, $M(7) = 1$, and $M(20) = 4$.

It can be verified that $\sum{M(n)^3} = 8150$ for $1 \le n \le
20$.

Find $\sum{M(n)^3}$ for $1 \le n \le 1000$.

Problem 392
===========

A rectilinear grid is an orthogonal grid where the spacing between the
gridlines does not have to be equidistant.
An example of such grid is logarithmic graph paper.

Consider rectilinear grids in the Cartesian coordinate system with the
following properties:

-   The gridlines are parallel to the axes of the Cartesian coordinate
    system.
-   There are $N+2$ vertical and $N+2$ horizontal gridlines. Hence
    there are $(N+1) \times (N+1)$ rectangular cells.
-   The equations of the two outer vertical gridlines are $x = -1$ and
    $x = 1$.
-   The equations of the two outer horizontal gridlines are $y = -1$
    and $y = 1$.
-   The grid cells are colored red if they overlap with the **unit
    circle[The unit circle is the circle that has radius $1$ and is
    centered at the origin]{.tooltiptext}**, black otherwise.

For this problem we would like you to find the positions of the
remaining $N$ inner horizontal and $N$ inner vertical gridlines so
that the area occupied by the red cells is minimized.

E.g. here is a picture of the solution for $N = 10$:

![0392\_gridlines.png](resources/images/0392_gridlines.png?1678992053)

The area occupied by the red cells for $N = 10$ rounded to $10$
digits behind the decimal point is $3.3469640797$.

Find the positions for $N = 400$.
Give as your answer the area occupied by the red cells rounded to $10$
digits behind the decimal point.

An $n \times n$ grid of squares contains $n^2$ ants, one ant per
square.
All ants decide to move simultaneously to an adjacent square (usually
$4$ possibilities, except for ants on the edge of the grid or at the
corners).
We define $f(n)$ to be the number of ways this can happen without any
ants ending on the same square and without any two ants crossing the
same edge between two squares.

You are given that $f(4) = 88$.
Find $f(10)$.

Problem 394
===========

Jeff eats a pie in an unusual way.
The pie is circular. He starts with slicing an initial cut in the pie
along a radius.
While there is at least a given fraction $F$ of pie left, he performs
the following procedure:
- He makes two slices from the pie centre to any point of what is
remaining of the pie border, any point on the remaining pie border
equally likely. This will divide the remaining pie into three pieces.
- Going counterclockwise from the initial cut, he takes the first two
pie pieces and eats them.
When less than a fraction $F$ of pie remains, he does not repeat this
procedure. Instead, he eats all of the remaining pie.

![0394\_eatpie.gif](resources/images/0394_eatpie.gif?1678992056)

For $x \ge 1$, let $E(x)$ be the expected number of times Jeff
repeats the procedure above with $F = 1/x$.
It can be verified that $E(1) = 1$, $E(2) \approx 1.2676536759$,
and $E(7.5) \approx 2.1215732071$.

Find $E(40)$ rounded to $10$ decimal places behind the decimal

Problem 395
===========

The **Pythagorean tree** is a fractal generated by the following
procedure:

Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in
the animation, the bottom side is the base):

1.  Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the
    hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a
    $3\text - 4\text - 5$ ratio. Note that the smaller side of the
    triangle must be on the \'right\' side with respect to the base (see
    animation).
2.  Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its
    sides coinciding with that leg.
3.  Repeat this procedure for both squares, considering as their bases
    the sides touching the triangle.

The resulting figure, after an infinite number of iterations, is the
Pythagorean tree.

Problem 396
===========

For any positive integer $n$, the **$n$th weak Goodstein sequence**
$\{g\_1, g\_2, g\_3, \dots\}$ is defined as:

-   $g\_1 = n$
-   for $k \gt 1$, $g\_k$ is obtained by writing $g\_{k-1}$ in
    base $k$, interpreting it as a base $k + 1$ number, and
    subtracting $1$.

The sequence terminates when $g\_k$ becomes $0$.

For example, the $6$th weak Goodstein sequence is $\{6, 11, 17, 25,
\dots\}$:

-   $g\_1 = 6$.
-   $g\_2 = 11$ since $6 = 110\_2$, $110\_3 = 12$, and $12 - 1 =
    11$.
-   $g\_3 = 17$ since $11 = 102\_3$, $102\_4 = 18$, and $18 - 1 =
    17$.
-   $g\_4 = 25$ since $17 = 101\_4$, $101\_5 = 26$, and $26 - 1 =
    25$.

and so on.

It can be shown that every weak Goodstein sequence terminates.

Let $G(n)$ be the number of nonzero elements in the $n$th weak
Goodstein sequence.
It can be verified that $G(2) = 3$, $G(4) = 21$ and $G(6) = 381$.
It can also be verified that $\sum G(n) = 2517$ for $1 \le n \lt

On the parabola $y = x^2/k$, three points $A(a, a^2/k)$, $B(b,

Find $F(10^6, 10^9)$.

Problem 398
===========

Inside a rope of length $n$, $n - 1$ points are placed with distance
$1$ from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we
choose $m - 1$ points at random and cut the rope at these points to
create $m$ segments.

Let $E(n, m)$ be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.
For example, $E(3, 2) = 2$ and $E(8, 3) = 16/7$. Note that if
multiple segments have the same shortest length the length of the
second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the shortest length.

The first $15$ Fibonacci numbers are:
$1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610$.
It can be seen that $8$ and $144$ are not squarefree: $8$ is
divisible by $4$ and $144$ is divisible by $4$ and by $9$.
So the first $13$ squarefree Fibonacci numbers are:
$1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377$ and $610$.

The $200$th squarefree Fibonacci number is:
$971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445$.
The last sixteen digits of this number are: $1608739584170445$ and in
scientific notation this number can be written as $9.7\mathrm e53$.

Find the $100\,000\,000$th squarefree Fibonacci number.
Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed
by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the
decimal point).
For the $200$th squarefree number the answer would have been:
1608739584170445,9.7e53

Note:
For this problem, assume that for every prime $p$, the first fibonacci
number divisible by $p$ is not divisible by $p^2$ (this is part of
**Wall\'s conjecture**). This has been verified for primes $\le 3
\cdot 10^{15}$, but has not been proven in general.
If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to
this problem isn\'t guaranteed to be the $100\,000\,000$th
squarefree Fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for
that number.

A **Fibonacci tree** is a binary tree recursively defined as:

-   $T(0)$ is the empty tree.
-   $T(1)$ is the binary tree with only one node.
-   $T(k)$ consists of a root node that has $T(k-1)$ and $T(k-2)$

selects a node and removes that node along with the subtree rooted at
that node.

For example, $f(1) = 0$, $f(4) = 82$ and $f(10^9) \bmod 17^7 =
126897180$.

Find $f(10^k)$ for $k = 10^{18}$, give your answer modulo
$17^7$.

Problem 406
===========

We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers
$\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ by asking questions. Each number (question) we
ask, we get one of three possible answers:

-   \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost
    of $a$), or
-   \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\" (and you incur a
    cost of $b$), or
-   \"Yes, that\'s it!\" (and the game ends).

Given the value of $n$, $a$, and $b$, an [optimal strategy]{.dfn}
minimizes the total cost [for the worst possible case]{.underline}.

For example, if $n = 5$, $a = 2$, and $b = 3$, then we may begin
by asking \"**2**\" as our first question.

If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
`b`{.variable}=3), then we are sure that \"**1**\" is the hidden number
(for a total cost of [**3**]{style="color:#3333ff;"}).
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of
`a`{.variable}=2), then our next question will be \"**4**\".
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of
`b`{.variable}=3), then we are sure that \"**3**\" is the hidden number
(for a total cost of 2+3=[**5**]{style="color:#3333ff;"}).
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of
`a`{.variable}=2), then we are sure that \"**5**\" is the hidden number
(for a total cost of 2+2=[**4**]{style="color:#3333ff;"}).
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is
[**5**]{style="color:#FF0000;"}. It can also be shown that this is the
lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. So, in fact, we have just
described an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and
$b$.

Let $C(n, a, b)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal
strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$ and $b$.

Here are a few examples:
$C(5, 2, 3) = 5$
$C(500, \sqrt 2, \sqrt 3) = 13.22073197\dots$
$C(20000, 5, 7) = 82$
$C(2000000, \sqrt 5, \sqrt 7) = 49.63755955\dots$

Let $F\_k$ be the Fibonacci numbers: $F\_k=F\_{k-1}+F\_{k-2}$ with
base cases $F\_1=F\_2= 1$.
Find $\displaystyle \sum \limits\_{k = 1}^{30} {C \left (10^{12},
\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{F\_k} \right )}$, and give your answer rounded to 8
decimal places behind the decimal point.

Problem 407
===========

If we calculate $a^2 \bmod 6$ for $0 \leq a \leq 5$ we get:
$0,1,4,3,4,1$.

The largest value of $a$ such that $a^2 \equiv a \bmod 6$ is
$4$.
Let\'s call $M(n)$ the largest value of $a \lt n$ such that $a^2
\equiv a \pmod n$.
So $M(6) = 4$.

Find $\sum M(n)$ for $1 \leq n \leq 10^7$.

Problem 408
===========

Let\'s call a lattice point $(x, y)$ [inadmissible]{.dfn} if $x, y$
and $x+y$ are all positive perfect squares.
For example, $(9, 16)$ is inadmissible, while $(0, 4)$, $(3, 1)$
and $(9, 4)$ are not.

Consider a path from point $(x\_1, y\_1)$ to point $(x\_2, y\_2)$
using only unit steps north or east.
Let\'s call such a path [admissible]{.dfn} if none of its intermediate
points are inadmissible.

Let $P(n)$ be the number of admissible paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(n,
n)$.
It can be verified that $P(5) = 252$, $P(16) = 596994440$ and
$P(1000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 341920854$.

Find $P(10\,000\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 409
===========

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Consider **nim** positions where:

-   There are $n$ non-empty piles.
-   Each pile has size less than $2^n$.
-   No two piles have the same size.

Let $W(n)$ be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above
conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning
strategy). For example, $W(1) = 1$, $W(2) = 6$, $W(3) = 168$,
$W(5) = 19764360$ and $W(100) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 =
384777056$.

Find $W(10\,000\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 410
===========

Let $C$ be the circle with radius $r$, $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. We
choose two points $P(a, b)$ and $Q(-a, c)$ so that the line passing
through $P$ and $Q$ is tangent to $C$.

For example, the quadruplet $(r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7)$ satisfies
this property.

Let $F(R, X)$ be the number of the integer quadruplets $(r, a, b,
c)$ with this property, and with $0 \lt r \leq R$ and $0 \lt a
\leq X$.

We can verify that $F(1, 5) = 10$, $F(2, 10) = 52$ and $F(10, 100)
= 3384$.
Find $F(10^8, 10^9) + F(10^9, 10^8)$.

Problem 411
===========

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the
coordinates $(x, y) = (2^i \bmod n, 3^i \bmod n)$ for $0 \leq i
\leq 2n$. We will consider stations with the same coordinates as the
same station.

We wish to form a path from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ such that the $x$
and $y$ coordinates never decrease.
Let $S(n)$ be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass
through.

For example, if $n = 22$, there are $11$ distinct stations, and a
valid path can pass through at most $5$ stations. Therefore, $S(22) =
5$. The case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:

![0411\_longpath.png](resources/images/0411_longpath.png?1678992053)

It can also be verified that $S(123) = 14$ and $S(10000) = 48$.

Find $\sum S(k^5)$ for $1 \leq k \leq 30$.

Problem 412
===========

For integers $m, n$ ($0 \leq n \lt m$), let $L(m, n)$ be an $m
\times m$ grid with the top-right $n \times n$ grid removed.

For example, $L(5, 3)$ looks like this:

![0412\_table53.png](resources/images/0412_table53.png?1678992053)

We want to number each cell of $L(m, n)$ with consecutive integers
$1, 2, 3, \dots$ such that the number in every cell is smaller than
the number below it and to the left of it.

For example, here are two valid numberings of $L(5, 3)$:

![0412\_tablenums.png](resources/images/0412_tablenums.png?1678992053)

Let $\operatorname{LC}(m, n)$ be the number of valid numberings of
$L(m, n)$.
It can be verified that $\operatorname{LC}(3, 0) = 42$,
$\operatorname{LC}(5, 3) = 250250$, $\operatorname{LC}(6, 3) =
406029023400$ and $\operatorname{LC}(10, 5) \bmod 76543217 =
61251715$.

Find $\operatorname{LC}(10000, 5000) \bmod 76543217$.

Problem 413
===========

We say that a $d$-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a
one-child number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by
$d$.

For example, $5671$ is a $4$-digit one-child number. Among all its
sub-strings $5$, $6$, $7$, $1$, $56$, $67$, $71$, $567$,
$671$ and $5671$, only $56$ is divisible by $4$.
Similarly, $104$ is a $3$-digit one-child number because only $0$
is divisible by $3$.
$1132451$ is a $7$-digit one-child number because only $245$ is
divisible by $7$.

Let $F(N)$ be the number of the one-child numbers less than $N$.
We can verify that $F(10) = 9$, $F(10^3) = 389$ and $F(10^7) =
277674$.

Find $F(10^{19})$.

Problem 414
===========

$6174$ is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing
order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the
digits in decreasing order, we get $7641-1467=6174$.
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any $4$ digit number and
repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we\'ll eventually end up
with $6174$ or immediately with $0$ if all digits are equal.
This also works with numbers that have less than $4$ digits if we pad
the number with leading zeroes until we have $4$ digits.
E.g. let\'s start with the number $0837$:
$8730-0378=8352$
$8532-2358=6174$

$6174$ is called the **Kaprekar constant**. The process of sorting and
subtracting and repeating this until either $0$ or the Kaprekar
constant is reached is called the **Kaprekar routine**.

We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of
digits.
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all
cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers
or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different
input numbers.
However, it can be shown that for $5$ digits and a base $b =
6t+3\neq 9$, a Kaprekar constant exists.
E.g. base $15$: $(10,4,14,9,5)\_{15}$
base $21$: $(14,6,20,13,7)\_{21}$

Define $C\_b$ to be the Kaprekar constant in base $b$ for $5$
digits. Define the function $sb(i)$ to be

-   $0$ if $i = C\_b$ or if $i$ written in base $b$ consists of
    $5$ identical digits
-   the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base $b$
    to arrive at $C\_b$, otherwise

Note that we can define $sb(i)$ for all integers $i \lt b^5$. If
$i$ written in base $b$ takes less than $5$ digits, the number is
padded with leading zero digits until we have $5$ digits before
applying the Kaprekar routine.

Define $S(b)$ as the sum of $sb(i)$ for $0 \lt i \lt b^5$.
E.g. $S(15) = 5274369$
$S(111) = 400668930299$

Find the sum of $S(6k+3)$ for $2 \leq k \leq 300$.
Give the last $18$ digits as your answer.

Problem 415
===========

A set of lattice points $S$ is called a [titanic set]{.dfn} if there
exists a line passing through exactly two points in $S$.

An example of a titanic set is $S = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1),
(2, 0), (1, 0)\}$, where the line passing through $(0, 1)$ and $(2,
0)$ does not pass through any other point in $S$.

On the other hand, the set $\{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)\}$ is
not a titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the
set also passes through the other two.

For any positive integer $N$, let $T(N)$ be the number of titanic
sets $S$ whose every point $(x, y)$ satisfies $0 \leq x, y \leq
N$. It can be verified that $T(1) = 11$, $T(2) = 494$, $T(4) =
33554178$, $T(111) \bmod 10^8 = 13500401$ and $T(10^5) \bmod
10^8 = 63259062$.

Find $T(10^{11})\bmod 10^8$.

Problem 416
===========

A row of $n$ squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By
successive jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to
the leftmost square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three
squares to the right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a
similar manner. He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the
round-trip travel $m$ times.

Let $F(m, n)$ be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at
most one square remains unvisited.
For example, $F(1, 3) = 4$, $F(1, 4) = 15$, $F(1, 5) = 46$, $F(2,
3) = 16$ and $F(2, 100) \bmod 10^9 = 429619151$.

Find the last $9$ digits of $F(10, 10^{12})$.

Problem 417
===========

A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal
representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$
are given:

\begin{align} 1/2 &= 0.5\\ 1/3 &=0.(3)\\ 1/4 &=0.25\\ 1/5 &=
0.2\\ 1/6 &= 0.1(6)\\ 1/7 &= 0.(142857)\\ 1/8 &= 0.125\\ 1/9 &=
0.(1)\\ 1/10 &= 0.1 \end{align}

Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit
recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring
cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than $2$
and/or $5$ are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as
$0$.

Let $L(n)$ denote the length of the recurring cycle of $1/n$. You
are given that $\sum L(n)$ for $3 \leq n \leq 1\,000\,000$
equals $55535191115$.

Find $\sum L(n)$ for $3 \leq n \leq 100\,000\,000$.

Problem 418
===========

Let $n$ be a positive integer. An integer triple $(a, b, c)$ is
called a [factorisation triple]{.dfn} of $n$ if:

-   $1 \leq a \leq b \leq c$
-   $a \cdot b \cdot c = n$.

Define $f(n)$ to be $a + b + c$ for the factorisation triple $(a,
b, c)$ of $n$ which minimises $c / a$. One can show that this
triple is unique.

For example, $f(165) = 19$, $f(100100) = 142$ and $f(20!) =
4034872$.

Find $f(43!)$.

Problem 419
===========

The **look and say** sequence goes 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211,
13112221, 1113213211, \...
The sequence starts with 1 and all other members are obtained by
describing the previous member in terms of consecutive digits.
It helps to do this out loud:
1 is \'one one\' → 11
11 is \'two ones\' → 21
21 is \'one two and one one\' → 1211
1211 is \'one one, one two and two ones\' → 111221
111221 is \'three ones, two twos and one one\' → 312211
\...

Define $A(n)$, $B(n)$ and $C(n)$ as the number of ones, twos and
threes in the $n$\'th element of the sequence respectively.
One can verify that $A(40) = 31254$, $B(40) = 20259$ and $C(40) =
11625$.

Find $A(n)$, $B(n)$ and $C(n)$ for $n = 10^{12}$.
Give your answer modulo $2^{30}$ and separate your values for $A$,
$B$ and $C$ by a comma.
E.g. for $n = 40$ the answer would be 31254,20259,11625

Problem 420
===========

A [positive integer matrix]{.dfn} is a matrix whose elements are all
positive integers.
Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a
positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:

$$\begin{pmatrix} 40 & 12\\ 48 & 40 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3\\ 12 & 2 \end{pmatrix}^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 6
& 1\\ 4 & 6 \end{pmatrix}^2 $$

We define $F(N)$ as the number of the $2\times 2$ positive integer
matrices which have a **trace[the sum of the elements on the main
diagonal]{.tooltiptext}** less than $N$ and which can be expressed as
a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.
We can verify that $F(50) = 7$ and $F(1000) = 1019$.

Find $F(10^7)$.

Problem 421
===========

Numbers of the form $n^{15}+1$ are composite for every integer $n
\gt 1$.
For positive integers $n$ and $m$ let $s(n,m)$ be defined as the
sum of the *distinct* prime factors of $n^{15}+1$ not exceeding
$m$.

E.g. $2^{15}+1 = 3 \times 3 \times 11 \times 331$.
So $s(2,10) = 3$ and $s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345$.

Also $10^{15}+1 = 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 211 \times 241
\times 2161 \times 9091$.
So $s(10,100) = 31$ and $s(10,1000) = 483$.

Find $\sum s(n,10^8)$ for $1 \leq n \leq 10^{11}$.

Problem 422
===========

Let $H$ be the hyperbola defined by the equation $12x^2 + 7xy -
12y^2 = 625$.

Next, define $X$ as the point $(7, 1)$. It can be seen that $X$ is
in $H$.

Now we define a sequence of points in $H$, $\{P\_i: i \geq 1\}$,
as:

-   $P\_1 = (13, 61/4)$.
-   $P\_2 = (-43/6, -4)$.
-   For $i \gt 2$, $P\_i$ is the unique point in $H$ that is
    different from $P\_{i-1}$ and such that line $P\_iP\_{i-1}$ is
    parallel to line $P\_{i-2}X$. It can be shown that $P\_i$ is
    well-defined, and that its coordinates are always rational.

274748766781/1719926784)$.

Find $P\_n$ for $n = 11^{14}$ in the following format:
If $P\_n = (a/b, c/d)$ where the fractions are in lowest terms and the
denominators are positive, then the answer is $(a + b + c + d) \bmod
1\,000\,000\,007$.

For $n = 7$, the answer would have been: $806236837$.

Problem 423
===========

Let $n$ be a positive integer.
A 6-sided die is thrown $n$ times. Let $c$ be the number of pairs of
consecutive throws that give the same value.

For example, if $n = 7$ and the values of the die throws are
(1,1,5,6,6,6,3), then the following pairs of consecutive throws give the
same value:
([1,1]{.underline},5,6,6,6,3)
(1,1,5,[6,6]{.underline},6,3)
(1,1,5,6,[6,6]{.underline},3)
Therefore, $c = 3$ for (1,1,5,6,6,6,3).

Define $C(n)$ as the number of outcomes of throwing a 6-sided die
$n$ times such that $c$ does not exceed $\pi(n)$.^1^
For example, $C(3) = 216$, $C(4) = 1290$, $C(11) = 361912500$ and
$C(24) = 4727547363281250000$.

Define $S(L)$ as $\sum C(n)$ for $1 \leq n \leq L$.
For example, $S(50) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 832833871$.

Find $S(50\,000\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

:::

The above is an example of a cryptic kakuro (also known as cross sums,
or even sums cross) puzzle, with its final solution on the right. (The
common rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet
sites. Other related information can also be currently found at
[krazydad.com](http://krazydad.com/) whose author has provided the
puzzle data for this challenge.)

The downloadable text file
([kakuro200.txt](project/resources/p424_kakuro200.txt)) contains the
description of 200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first
puzzle in the file is the above example which is coded as follows:

6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X

The first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the
information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a
7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and
left column are needed to insert information.

The content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma,
going left to right and starting with the top line.
X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by
its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a
lower case \"h\" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case \"v\".
Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum
is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first
letter would be for the \"tens\" and the second one for the \"units\".
When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a
vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two
are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD).
Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.

The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line
Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.

The required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter
necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical
order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be
8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part
of the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must
be assigned the remaining digit.

You are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in
the file is 64414157580.

Find the sum of the answers for the 200 puzzles.

Problem 425
===========

Two positive numbers $A$ and $B$ are said to be [connected]{.dfn}
(denoted by \"$A \leftrightarrow B$\") if one of these conditions
holds:
(1) $A$ and $B$ have the same length and differ in exactly one
digit; for example, $123 \leftrightarrow 173$.
(2) Adding one digit to the left of $A$ (or $B$) makes $B$ (or
$A$); for example, $23 \leftrightarrow 223$ and $123
\leftrightarrow 23$.

We call a prime $P$ a [$2$\'s relative]{.dfn} if there exists a
chain of connected primes between $2$ and $P$ and no prime in the
chain exceeds $P$.

For example, $127$ is a $2$\'s relative. One of the possible chains
is shown below:
$2 \leftrightarrow 3 \leftrightarrow 13 \leftrightarrow 113
\leftrightarrow 103 \leftrightarrow 107 \leftrightarrow 127$
However, $11$ and $103$ are not $2$\'s relatives.

Let $F(N)$ be the sum of the primes $\leq N$ which are not $2$\'s
relatives.
We can verify that $F(10^3) = 431$ and $F(10^4) = 78728$.

Find $F(10^7)$.

Problem 426
===========

Consider an infinite row of boxes. Some of the boxes contain a ball. For
example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes
followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied
boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the
number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.

A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the
following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to
the nearest empty box to its right.

After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as
can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the

A system like this is called a **Box-Ball System** or **BBS** for short.

It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system
evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is
invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of **occupied
boxes** evolves to \[1, 2, 3\]; we shall call this the final state.

We define the sequence {`t`{.variable}~`i`{.variable}~}:

-   `s`{.variable}~0~ = 290797
-   `s`{.variable}~`k`{.variable}+1~ = `s`{.variable}~`k`{.variable}~^2^

Problem 427
===========

A sequence of integers $S = \{s\_i\}$ is called an $n$-sequence if
it has $n$ elements and each element $s\_i$ satisfies $1 \leq s\_i
\leq n$. Thus there are $n^n$ distinct $n$-sequences in total.
For example, the sequence $S = \{1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7\}$ is
a $10$-sequence.

For any sequence $S$, let $L(S)$ be the length of the longest
contiguous subsequence of $S$ with the same value. For example, for
the given sequence $S$ above, $L(S) = 3$, because of the three
consecutive $7$\'s.

Let $f(n) = \sum L(S)$ for all $n$-sequences S.

For example, $f(3) = 45$, $f(7) = 1403689$ and $f(11) =
481496895121$.

Find $f(7\,500\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,009$.

Problem 428
===========

Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be positive numbers.
Let $W, X, Y, Z$ be four collinear points where $\|WX\| = a$,
$\|XY\| = b$, $\|YZ\| = c$ and $\|WZ\| = a + b + c$.
Let $C\_{in}$ be the circle having the diameter $XY$.
Let $C\_{out}$ be the circle having the diameter $WZ$.

The triplet $(a, b, c)$ is called a [necklace triplet]{.dfn} if you
can place $k \geq 3$ distinct circles $C\_1, C\_2, \dots, C\_k$
such that:

-   $C\_i$ has no common interior points with any $C\_j$ for $1
    \leq i, j \leq k$ and $i \neq j$,
-   $C\_i$ is tangent to both $C\_{in}$ and $C\_{out}$ for $1
    \leq i \leq k$,
-   $C\_i$ is tangent to $C\_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i \lt k$, and
-   $C\_k$ is tangent to $C\_1$.

For example, $(5, 5, 5)$ and $(4, 3, 21)$ are necklace triplets,
while it can be shown that $(2, 2, 5)$ is not.

![0428\_necklace.png](resources/images/0428_necklace.png?1678992053){.dark_img}

Let $T(n)$ be the number of necklace triplets $(a, b, c)$ such that
$a$, $b$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $b \leq n$. For
example, $T(1) = 9$, $T(20) = 732$ and $T(3000) = 438106$.

Find $T(1\,000\,000\,000)$.

Problem 429
===========

A unitary divisor $d$ of a number $n$ is a divisor of $n$ that has
the property $\gcd(d, n/d) = 1$.
The unitary divisors of $4! = 24$ are $1, 3, 8$ and $24$.
The sum of their squares is $1^2 + 3^2 + 8^2 + 24^2 = 650$.

Let $S(n)$ represent the sum of the squares of the unitary divisors of
$n$. Thus $S(4!)=650$.

Find $S(100\,000\,000!)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,009$.

Problem 430
===========

$N$ disks are placed in a row, indexed $1$ to $N$ from left to
right.
Each disk has a black side and white side. Initially all disks show
their white side.

At each turn, two, not necessarily distinct, integers $A$ and $B$
between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive) are chosen uniformly at random.
All disks with an index from $A$ to $B$ (inclusive) are flipped.

The following example shows the case $N = 8$. At the first turn $A =
5$ and $B = 2$, and at the second turn $A = 4$ and $B = 6$.

![0430\_flips.gif](resources/images/0430_flips.gif?1678992057){.dark_img}

Let $E(N, M)$ be the expected number of disks that show their white
side after $M$ turns.
We can verify that $E(3, 1) = 10/9$, $E(3, 2) = 5/3$, $E(10, 4)
\approx 5.157$ and $E(100, 10) \approx 51.893$.

Find $E(10^{10}, 4000)$.
Give your answer rounded to $2$ decimal places behind the decimal
point.

Problem 431
===========

Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his
farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely
devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the
representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that
they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is
resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is
removed from his property.

Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are
delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle
made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if
the angle of repose, $\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at
the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of
the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of
$6\mathrm m$, the amount of space wasted would be approximately
$32.648388556\mathrm{m^3}$. However, if grain is delivered at a
point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from
the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is
formed. He shows Fred a picture.

::: {.center}
![0431\_grain\_silo.png](resources/images/0431_grain_silo.png?1678992053){.dark_img}
:::

We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by
$V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared
decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284)
\approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem
there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \approx 49$. It
would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in
splendid glory on top of your grain.

Fred\'s eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on
closer inspection of Quentin\'s drawings and calculations his happiness
turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it\'s
the radius of the silo that is $6$ metres, not the diameter, and the
angle of repose for his grain is $40$ degrees. However, if Quentin can
find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more
than happy to keep it.

If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the
farmer\'s appetite for all things square then determine the values of
$x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate
$\sum x$ correct to $9$ decimal places.

Let $E(x\_0, y\_0)$ be the number of steps it takes to determine the

$x\_1 = y\_0$, $y\_1 = x\_0 \bmod y\_0$
$x\_n = y\_{n-1}$, $y\_n = x\_{n-1} \bmod y\_{n-1}$
$E(x\_0, y\_0)$ is the smallest $n$ such that $y\_n = 0$.

Problem 434
===========

Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the
vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called
adjacent.
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex
with a point in the Euclidean space.
A **flexible** graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to
move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at
least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between
each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
A **rigid** graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully
rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and
inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the
rest of the graph.

The **grid graphs** embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as
the following animation demonstrates:

::: {.center}
![0434\_rigid.gif](resources/images/0434_rigid.gif?1678992057){.dark_img}
:::

However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells.
For example, for the $2\times 3$ grid graph, there are $19$ ways to
make the graph rigid:

::: {.center}
![0434\_rigid23.png](resources/images/0434_rigid23.png?1678992053){.dark_img}
:::

Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing
the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a
cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

Let $R(m,n)$ be the number of ways to make the $m \times n$ grid
graph rigid.
E.g. $R(2,3) = 19$ and $R(5,5) = 23679901$.

Define $S(N)$ as $\sum R(i,j)$ for $1 \leq i, j \leq N$.
E.g. $S(5) = 25021721$.
Find $S(100)$, give your answer modulo $1000000033$.

The **Fibonacci numbers** $\{f\_n, n \ge 0\}$ are defined
recursively as $f\_n = f\_{n-1} + f\_{n-2}$ with base cases $f\_0 =
0$ and $f\_1 = 1$.

Define the polynomials $\{F\_n, n \ge 0\}$ as $F\_n(x) =
\displaystyle{\sum\_{i=0}^n f\_i x^i}$.

For example, $F\_7(x) = x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + 5x^5 + 8x^6 +
13x^7$, and $F\_7(11) = 268\,357\,683$.

Let $n = 10^{15}$. Find the sum $\displaystyle{\sum\_{x=0}^{100}

Problem 436
===========

Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.
She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the
dishes.
For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers
uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$.
The game starts with $S = 0$.
The first player, Louise, adds to $S$ different random numbers from
the generator until $S \gt 1$ and records her last random number
\'$x$\'.
The second player, Julie, continues adding to $S$ different random
numbers from the generator until $S \gt 2$ and records her last
random number \'$y$\'.
The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes,
i.e. if $y \gt x$ the second player wins.

For example, if the first player draws $0.62$ and $0.44$, the first
player turn ends since $0.62+0.44 \gt 1$ and $x = 0.44$.
If the second players draws $0.1$, $0.27$ and $0.91$, the second
player turn ends since $0.62+0.44+0.1+0.27+0.91 \gt 2$ and $y =
0.91$. Since $y \gt x$, the second player wins.

Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: \"That\'s not fair\".
What is the probability that the second player wins?

Problem 437
===========

When we calculate $8^n$ modulo $11$ for $n=0$ to $9$ we get:
$1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7$.
As we see all possible values from $1$ to $10$ occur. So $8$ is a
**primitive root** of $11$.
But there is more:
If we take a closer look we see:
$1+8=9$
$8+9=17 \equiv 6 \bmod 11$
$9+6=15 \equiv 4 \bmod 11$
$6+4=10$
$4+10=14 \equiv 3 \bmod 11$
$10+3=13 \equiv 2 \bmod 11$
$3+2=5$
$2+5=7$
$5+7=12 \equiv 1 \bmod 11$.

So the powers of $8 \bmod 11$ are cyclic with period $10$, and
$8^n + 8^{n+1} \equiv 8^{n+2} \pmod{11}$.
$8$ is called a **Fibonacci primitive root** of $11$.
Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.
There are $323$ primes less than $10000$ with one or more Fibonacci
primitive roots and the sum of these primes is $1480491$.

Problem 444
===========

A group of $p$ people decide to sit down at a round table and play a
lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a
randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when
scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to
£$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of
the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon
leaving the game.

An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the
table, each player has only one of two options:

1.  The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to
    everyone at the table.
2.  If the player\'s ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it
    with a previous player\'s scratched ticket, and then leaves the game
    with that ticket. The previous player then scratches the
    newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the
    table.

The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still
remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.

Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the
expected value of their ticket winnings.

Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table
when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players.
E.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits.

inside a larger circle. The parametric equations of a hypocycloid
centered at the origin, and starting at the right most point is given
by:

$$x(t) = (R - r) \cos(t) + r \cos(\frac {R - r} r t)$$ $$y(t) =
(R - r) \sin(t) - r \sin(\frac {R - r} r t)$$

Where $R$ is the radius of the large circle and $r$ the radius of
the small circle.

Let $C(R, r)$ be the set of distinct points with integer coordinates
on the hypocycloid with radius `R`{.variable} and `r`{.variable} and for
which there is a corresponding value of `t`{.variable} such that
$\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$ are rational numbers.

Let $S(R, r) = \sum\_{(x,y) \in C(R, r)} \|x\| + \|y\|$ be the sum
of the absolute values of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the points
in $C(R, r)$.

Let $T(N) = \sum\_{R = 3}^N \sum\_{r=1}^{\lfloor \frac {R - 1} 2
\rfloor} S(R, r)$ be the sum of $S(R, r)$ for `R`{.variable} and
`r`{.variable} positive integers, $R\leq N$ and $2r \< R$.

You are given:

$C(3, 1)$

=

$\{(3, 0), (-1, 2), (-1,0), (-1,-2)\}$

$(-1356, 1088), (-1356, -1088), (-1500, 1000), (-1500, -1000)\}$

*Note:* $(-625, 0)$ is not an element of $C(2500, 1000)$ because
$\sin(t)$ is not a rational number for the corresponding values of
$t$.

$S(3, 1) = (\|3\| + \|0\|) + (\|-1\| + \|2\|) + (\|-1\| + \|0\|) +
(\|-1\| + \|-2\|) = 10$

Consider the number $15$.
There are eight positive numbers less than $15$ which are coprime to
$15$: $1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14$.
The modular inverses of these numbers modulo $15$ are: $1, 8, 4, 13,
2, 11, 7, 14$
because
$1 \cdot 1 \bmod 15=1$
$2 \cdot 8=16 \bmod 15=1$

The flipping game is a two player game played on an $N$ by $N$
square board.
Each square contains a disk with one side white and one side black.
The game starts with all disks showing their white side.

A turn consists of flipping all disks in a rectangle with the following
properties:

-   the upper right corner of the rectangle contains a white disk
-   the rectangle width is a perfect square ($1$, $4$, $9$,
    $16$, \...)
-   the rectangle height is a **triangular number[The triangular numbers

Problem 460
===========

On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point $A(0, 1)$ to point
$B(d, 1)$ for an integer $d$.

In each step, the ant at point $(x\_0, y\_0)$ chooses one of the
lattice points $(x\_1, y\_1)$ which satisfy $x\_1 \ge 0$ and $y\_1
\ge 1$ and goes straight to $(x\_1, y\_1)$ at a constant velocity
$v$. The value of $v$ depends on $y\_0$ and $y\_1$ as follows:

-   If $y\_0 = y\_1$, the value of $v$ equals $y\_0$.
-   If $y\_0 \ne y\_1$, the value of $v$ equals $(y\_1 - y\_0) /
    (\ln(y\_1) - \ln(y\_0))$.

The left image is one of the possible paths for $d = 4$. First the ant
goes from $A(0, 1)$ to $P\_1(1, 3)$ at velocity $(3 - 1) / (\ln(3)
- \ln(1)) \approx 1.8205$. Then the required time is $\sqrt 5 /
1.8205 \approx 1.2283$.
From $P\_1(1, 3)$ to $P\_2(3, 3)$ the ant travels at velocity $3$
so the required time is $2 / 3 \approx 0.6667$. From $P\_2(3, 3)$
to $B(4, 1)$ the ant travels at velocity $(1 - 3) / (\ln(1) -
\ln(3)) \approx 1.8205$ so the required time is $\sqrt 5 / 1.8205
\approx 1.2283$.
Thus the total required time is $1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233$.

The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated
as $0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052$. It can be shown that this is the
quickest path for $d = 4$.

![0460\_ant.jpg](resources/images/0460_ant.jpg?1678992054)

Let $F(d)$ be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest
path. For example, $F(4) \approx 2.960516287$.
We can verify that $F(10) \approx 4.668187834$ and $F(100) \approx
9.217221972$.

In fact, it is the best approximation of $\pi$ of the form $f\_n(a)
+ f\_n(b) + f\_n(c) + f\_n(d)$ for $n=200$.

Let $g(n)=a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for $a, b, c, d$ that minimize
the error: $\|f\_n(a) + f\_n(b) + f\_n(c) + f\_n(d) - \pi\|$
(where $\|x\|$ denotes the absolute value of $x$).

A **$3$-smooth number** is an integer which has no prime factor larger
than $3$. For an integer $N$, we define $S(N)$ as the set of
[$3$-smooth]{style="white-space:nowrap;"} numbers less than or equal
to $N$. For example, $S(20) = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18
\}$.

We define $F(N)$ as the number of permutations of $S(N)$ in which
each element comes after all of its proper divisors.

This is one of the possible permutations for $N = 20$.
- $1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 16, 6, 18, 12.$
This is not a valid permutation because $12$ comes before its divisor
$6$.
- $1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, \boldsymbol{12}, 16, \boldsymbol 6, 18$.

We can verify that $F(6) = 5$, $F(8) = 9$, $F(20) = 450$ and
$F(1000) \approx 8.8521816557\mathrm e21$.
Find $F(10^{18})$. Give as your answer its scientific notation
rounded to ten digits after the decimal point.
When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and
exponent. E.g. if the answer is $112\,233\,445\,566\,778\,899$
then the answer format would be 1.1223344557e17.

The **Möbius function**, denoted $\mu(n)$, is defined as:

-   $\mu(n) = (-1)^{\omega(n)}$ if $n$ is squarefree (where
    $\omega(n)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $n$)
-   $\mu(n) = 0$ if $n$ is not squarefree.

Let $P(a, b)$ be the number of integers $n$ in the interval $\[a,
b\]$ such that $\mu(n) = 1$.
Let $N(a, b)$ be the number of integers $n$ in the interval $\[a,
b\]$ such that $\mu(n) = -1$.
For example, $P(2,10) = 2$ and $N(2,10) = 4$.

Let $C(n)$ be the number of integer pairs $(a, b)$ such that:

-   $1\le a \le b \le n$,
-   $99 \cdot N(a, b) \le 100 \cdot P(a, b)$, and
-   $99 \cdot P(a, b) \le 100 \cdot N(a, b)$.

For example, $C(10) = 13$, $C(500) = 16676$ and $C(10\,000) =
20155319$.

Find $C(20\,000\,000)$.

Problem 465
===========

The [kernel]{.dfn} of a polygon is defined by the set of points from
which the entire polygon\'s boundary is visible. We define a [polar
polygon]{.dfn} as a polygon for which the origin is
[strictly]{.underline} contained inside its kernel.

For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices.
However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have
zero area.

For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the
kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the
origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):

![0465\_polygons.png](resources/images/0465_polygons.png?1678992053)

Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.

Let $P(n)$ be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices
$(x, y)$ have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not
greater than $n$.

Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different
set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the
polygon with vertices $\[(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)\]$ is distinct from
the polygon with vertices $\[(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)\]$.

For example, $P(1) = 131$, $P(2) = 1648531$, $P(3) =
1099461296175$ and $P(343) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 937293740$.

Problem 466

Let $P(m,n)$ be the number of *distinct* terms in an $m\times n$
multiplication table.

For example, a $3\times 4$ multiplication table looks like this:

  $\times$   1   2   3   4
  ------------- --- --- --- ----
  1             1   2   3   4
  2             2   4   6   8
  3             3   6   9   12

There are $8$ distinct terms $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12\}$, therefore
$P(3,4) = 8$.

You are given that:
$P(64,64) = 1263$,
$P(12,345) = 1998$, and
$P(32,10^{15}) = 13826382602124302$.

An integer $s$ is called a [superinteger]{.dfn} of another integer
$n$ if the digits of $n$ form a **subsequence[A subsequence is a
sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some
elements without changing the order of the remaining
elements.]{.tooltiptext}** of the digits of $s$.
For example, $2718281828$ is a superinteger of $18828$, while
$314159$ is not a superinteger of $151$.

Let $p(n)$ be the $n$th prime number, and let $c(n)$ be the
$n$th composite number. For example, $p(1) = 2$, $p(10) = 29$,
$c(1)$ = 4 and $c(10) = 18$.
$\{p(i) : i \ge 1\} = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,
\dots\}$
$\{c(i) : i \ge 1\} = \{4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18,
\dots\}$

Let $P^D$ be the sequence of the **digital roots** of $\{p(i)\}$
($C^D$ is defined similarly for $\{c(i)\}$):
$P^D = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5, 2, \dots\}$
$C^D = \{4, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, \dots\}$

Let $P\_n$ be the integer formed by concatenating the first $n$
elements of $P^D$ ($C\_n$ is defined similarly for $C^D$).
$P\_{10} = 2357248152$
$C\_{10} = 4689135679$

Let $f(n)$ be the smallest positive integer that is a common
superinteger of $P\_n$ and $C\_n$.
For example, $f(10) = 2357246891352679$, and $f(100) \bmod
1\,000\,000\,007 = 771661825$.

An integer is called **`B`{.variable}-smooth** if none of its prime
factors is greater than $B$.

$S\_4(2100) = 12$
$S\_{17}(2496144) = 5712$

Define $\displaystyle F(n)=\sum\_{B=1}^n \sum\_{r=0}^n
S\_B(\binom n r)$. Here, $\displaystyle \binom n r$ denotes the
binomial coefficient.
Examples:
$F(11) = 3132$
$F(1111) \mod 1\,000\,000\,993 = 706036312$
$F(111\,111) \mod 1\,000\,000\,993 = 22156169$

Knights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available
empty chair.
To have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty

We also define $E(N)$ as the expected value of $C$.

Problem 470
===========

Consider a single game of Ramvok:

Let $t$ represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If $t =
0$, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn $i$, the
player rolls a die. After rolling, if $i \lt t$ the player can either
stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current
roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If $i = t$, then
the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the
game begins, $t$ is chosen by the player, who must then pay an
up-front cost $ct$ for some constant $c$. For $c = 0$, $t$ can
be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of $0$). Let $R(d,
c)$ be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives
from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided
die and cost constant $c$. For example, $R(4, 0.2) = 2.65$. Assume
that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.

Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:

In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a
slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration
process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face
has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If
the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original
value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin
(and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face
with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and
which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces
of the die are blank.

Let $S(d, c)$ be the expected profit that the player receives from an
optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair $d$-sided die to
start (with all sides visible), and cost constant $c$. For example,
$S(6, 1) = 208.3$.

Let $F(n) = \sum\_{4 \le d \le n} \sum\_{0 \le c \le n} S(d,
c)$.

Calculate $F(20)$, rounded to the nearest integer.

3.  Each subsequent person chooses the seat furthest from anyone else
    already seated, as long as it does not violate rule 1. If there is
    more than one choice satisfying this condition, then the person
    chooses the leftmost choice.

Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and
the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than $N$ (for
$N \gt 1$).

Here are the possible seating arrangements for $N = 15$:

![0472\_n15.png](resources/images/0472_n15.png?1678992053){.dark_img}

We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the $15$ seats can
seat up to $7$ people.
We can also see that the first person has $9$ choices to maximize the
number of people that may be seated.

Let $f(N)$ be the number of choices the first person has to maximize
the number of occupants for $N$ seats in a row. Thus, $f(1) = 1$,
$f(15) = 9$, $f(20) = 6$, and $f(500) = 16$.

Also, $\sum f(N) = 83$ for $1 \le N \le 20$ and $\sum f(N) =
13343$ for $1 \le N \le 500$.

Find $\sum f(N)$ for $1 \le N \le 10^{12}$. Give the last $8$
digits of your answer.

Problem 473
===========

Let $\varphi$ be the golden ratio:
$\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.$
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of
powers of $\varphi$ even if we require that every power of
$\varphi$ is used at most once in this sum.
Even then this representation is not unique.
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive
exponents are used and that the representation is finite.
E.g: $2=\varphi+\varphi^{-2}$ and
$3=\varphi^{2}+\varphi^{-2}$

To represent this sum of powers of $\varphi$ we use a string of 0\'s
and 1\'s with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
We call this the representation in the **phigital numberbase**.
So $1=1\_{\varphi}$, $2=10.01\_{\varphi}$,
$3=100.01\_{\varphi}$ and $14=100100.001001\_{\varphi}$.
The strings representing $1$, $2$ and $14$ in the phigital number
base are palindromic, while the string representing $3$ is not.
(the phigital point is not the middle character).

The sum of the positive integers not exceeding $1000$ whose phigital
representation is palindromic is $4345$.

Find the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose
phigital representation is palindromic.

For a positive integer $n$ and digits $d$, we define $F(n, d)$ as

4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84$), three of them ($4, 14, 84$) have
the last digit $4$.

We can also verify that $F(12!, 12) = 11$ and $F(50!, 123) = 17888$.

It is a disaster. At the end of the day, all musicians decide they will
never again agree to play with any member of their quartet.

On the second day, they form $4n$ trios, with every musician avoiding
any previous quartet partners.

Let $f(12n)$ be the number of ways to organize the trios amongst the
$12n$ musicians.

You are given $f(12) = 576$ and $f(24) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 =

Problem 477
===========

The number sequence game starts with a sequence $S$ of $N$ numbers
written on a line.

Two players alternate turns. The players on their respective turns must
select and remove either the first or the last number remaining in the
sequence.

A player\'s own score is (determined by) the sum of all the numbers that
player has taken. Each player attempts to maximize their own sum.

If $N = 4$ and $S = \{1, 2, 10, 3\}$, then each player maximizes
their own score as follows:

-   Player 1: removes the first number ($1$)
-   Player 2: removes the last number from the remaining sequence
    ($3$)
-   Player 1: removes the last number from the remaining sequence
    ($10$)
-   Player 2: removes the remaining number ($2$)

Player 1 score is $1 + 10 = 11$.

Let $F(N)$ be the score of player 1 if both players follow the optimal
strategy for the sequence $S = \{s\_1, s\_2, \dots, s\_N\}$ defined
as:

-   $s\_1 = 0$
-   $s\_{i + 1} = (s\_i^2 + 45)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$

The sequence begins with $S=\{0, 45, 2070, 4284945, 753524550,
478107844, 894218625, \dots\}$.

You are given $F(2)=45$, $F(4)=4284990$, $F(100)=26365463243$,
$F(10^4)=2495838522951$.

Find $F(10^8)$.

Problem 478
===========

Let us consider **mixtures** of three substances: **A**, **B** and
**C**. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of **A**,
**B**, and **C** in it, i.e., $(a : b : c)$. For example, a mixture
described by the ratio $(2 : 3 : 5)$ contains $20\%$ **A**,
$30\%$ **B** and $50\%$ **C**.

For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual
components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of
different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.

For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios $(3 : 0 : 2)$,
$(3: 6 : 11)$ and $(3 : 3 : 4)$. By mixing $10$ units of the
first, $20$ units of the second and $30$ units of the third, we get
a new mixture with ratio $(6 : 5 : 9)$, since:
$(10 \cdot \tfrac 3 5$ + $20 \cdot \tfrac 3 {20} + 30 \cdot
\tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 0 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac 6 {20} + 30
\cdot \tfrac 3 {10} : 10 \cdot \tfrac 2 5 + 20 \cdot \tfrac {11}
{20} + 30 \cdot \tfrac 4 {10}) = (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)$

However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the
ratio $(3 : 2 : 1)$, since the amount of **B** is always less than the
amount of **C**.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of
integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $\gcd(a, b,
c) = 1$, we have a mixture with ratio $(a : b : c)$. Let $M(n)$ be
the set of all such mixtures.

For example, $M(2)$ contains the $19$ mixtures with the following
ratios:

\begin{align} \{&(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2),
(0 : 2 : 1),\\ &(1 : 0 : 0), (1 : 0 : 1), (1 : 0 : 2), (1 : 1 : 0), (1
: 1 : 1),\\ &(1 : 1 : 2), (1 : 2 : 0), (1 : 2 : 1), (1 : 2 : 2), (2 :
0 : 1),\\ &(2 : 1 : 0), (2 : 1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2), (2 : 2 : 1)\}.
\end{align}

Let $E(n)$ be the number of subsets of $M(n)$ which can produce the
mixture with ratio $(1 : 1 : 1)$, i.e., the mixture with equal parts
**A**, **B** and **C**.
We can verify that $E(1) = 103$, $E(2) = 520447$, $E(10) \bmod
11^8 = 82608406$ and $E(500) \bmod 11^8 = 13801403$.
Find $E(10\,000\,000) \bmod 11^8$.

Let $a\_k$, $b\_k$, and $c\_k$ represent the three solutions (real

approximately $\{5.727244, -0.363622+2.057397i,
-0.363622-2.057397i\}$.

Let $\displaystyle S(n) =
\sum\_{p=1}^n\sum\_{k=1}^n(a\_k+b\_k)^p(b\_k+c\_k)^p(c\_k+a\_k)^p$.

Interestingly, $S(n)$ is always an integer. For example, $S(4) =
51160$.

Find $S(10^6)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 481
===========

A group of chefs (numbered \#$1$, \#$2$, etc) participate in a
turn-based strategic cooking competition. On each chef\'s turn, he/she
cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a
separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let $S(k)$ represent chef
\#$k$\'s skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically,
$S(k)$ is the probability that chef \#$k$\'s dish will be assessed
favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a
favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be
eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the
competition is the winner.

The game always begins with chef \#$1$, with the turn order iterating
sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle
repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their
chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other
chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than
one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is
always the one with the next-closest turn.

Define $W\_n(k)$ as the probability that chef \#$k$ wins in a
competition with $n$ chefs. If we have $S(1) = 0.25$, $S(2) =
0.5$, and $S(3) = 1$, then $W\_3(1) = 0.29375$.

Going forward, we assign $S(k) = F\_k/F\_{n+1}$ over all $1 \le k
\le n$, where $F\_k$ is a Fibonacci number: $F\_k = F\_{k-1} +
F\_{k-2}$ with base cases $F\_1 = F\_2 = 1$. Then, for example, when
considering a competition with $n = 7$ chefs, we have $W\_7(1) =
0.08965042$, $W\_7(2) = 0.20775702$, $W\_7(3) = 0.15291406$,
$W\_7(4) = 0.14554098$, $W\_7(5) = 0.15905291$, $W\_7(6) =
0.10261412$, and $W\_7(7) = 0.14247050$, rounded to $8$ decimal
places each.

Let $E(n)$ represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a
competition with $n$ chefs. For instance, $E(7) = 42.28176050$.

Problem 483
===========

We define a [permutation]{.dfn} as an operation that rearranges the
order of the elements $\{1, 2, 3, \..., n\}$. There are $n!$ such
permutations, one of which leaves the elements in their initial order.
For $n = 3$ we have $3! = 6$ permutations:

-   $P\_1 =$ keep the initial order
-   $P\_2 =$ exchange the 1^st^ and 2^nd^ elements
-   $P\_3 =$ exchange the 1^st^ and 3^rd^ elements
-   $P\_4 =$ exchange the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ elements
-   $P\_5 =$ rotate the elements to the right
-   $P\_6 =$ rotate the elements to the left

If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the
[same]{.underline} permutation repeatedly, we eventually restore the
initial order.
For a permutation $P\_i$, let $f(P\_i)$ be the number of steps
required to restore the initial order by applying the permutation
$P\_i$ repeatedly.
For $n = 3$, we obtain:

-   $f(P\_1) = 1$ : $(1,2,3) \to (1,2,3)$
-   $f(P\_2) = 2$ : $(1,2,3) \to (2,1,3) \to (1,2,3)$
-   $f(P\_3) = 2$ : $(1,2,3) \to (3,2,1) \to (1,2,3)$
-   $f(P\_4) = 2$ : $(1,2,3) \to (1,3,2) \to (1,2,3)$
-   $f(P\_5) = 3$ : $(1,2,3) \to (3,1,2) \to (2,3,1) \to (1,2,3)$
-   $f(P\_6) = 3$ : $(1,2,3) \to (2,3,1) \to (3,1,2) \to (1,2,3)$

Let $g(n)$ be the average value of $f^2(P\_i)$ over all
permutations $P\_i$ of length $n$.
$g(3) = (1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2)/3! = 31/6 \approx
5.166666667\mathrm e0$
$g(5) = 2081/120 \approx 1.734166667\mathrm e1$
$g(20) = 12422728886023769167301/2432902008176640000 \approx

Problem 488

Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing **Nim** every day. However, they
finally got bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.
So, they added an extra rule:

\- Must not make two heaps of the same size.

The triple $(a, b, c)$ indicates the size of three heaps.
Under this extra rule, $(2,4,5)$ is one of the losing positions for
the next player.

To illustrate:
- Alice moves to $(2,4,3)$
- Bob moves to $(0,4,3)$
- Alice moves to $(0,2,3)$
- Bob moves to $(0,2,1)$

Unlike ordinary three-heap Nim, $(0,1,2)$ and its permutations are the
end states of this game.

For an integer $N$, we define $F(N)$ as the sum of $a + b + c$ for
all the losing positions for the next player, with $0 \lt a \lt b
\lt c \lt N$.

For example, $F(8) = 42$, because there are $4$ losing positions for
the next player, $(1,3,5)$, $(1,4,6)$, $(2,3,6)$ and $(2,4,5)$.
We can also verify that $F(128) = 496062$.

There are $n$ stones in a pond, numbered $1$ to $n$. Consecutive
stones are spaced one unit apart.

A frog sits on stone $1$. He wishes to visit each stone exactly once,
stopping on stone $n$. However, he can only jump from one stone to
another if they are at most $3$ units apart. In other words, from
stone $i$, he can reach a stone $j$ if $1 \le j \le n$ and $j$

Problem 493

Problem 494
===========

The Collatz sequence is defined as: $a\_{i+1} = \left\{
\large{\frac {a\_i} 2 \atop 3 a\_i+1} {\text{if }a\_i\text{ is
even} \atop \text{if }a\_i\text{ is odd}} \right.$.

The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer,
the sequence eventually reaches the cycle $1,4,2,1, \dots$.
We shall define the sequence prefix $p(n)$ for the Collatz sequence
starting with $a\_1 = n$ as the sub-sequence of all numbers not a
power of $2$ ($2^0=1$ is considered a power of $2$ for this
problem). For example:
$p(13) = \{13, 40, 20, 10, 5\}$
$p(8) = \{\}$
Any number invalidating the conjecture would have an infinite length
sequence prefix.

Let $S\_m$ be the set of all sequence prefixes of length $m$. Two
sequences $\{a\_1, a\_2, \dots, a\_m\}$ and $\{b\_1, b\_2,
\dots, b\_m\}$ in $S\_m$ are said to belong to the same prefix
family if $a\_i \lt a\_j$ if and only if $b\_i \lt b\_j$ for all
$1 \le i,j \le m$.

For example, in $S\_4$, $\{6, 3, 10, 5\}$ is in the same family as
$\{454, 227, 682, 341\}$, but not $\{113, 340, 170, 85\}$.
Let $f(m)$ be the number of distinct prefix families in $S\_m$.
You are given $f(5) = 5$, $f(10) = 55$, $f(20) = 6771$.

Find $f(90)$.

Problem 495
===========

Let $W(n,k)$ be the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as
the product of $k$ distinct positive integers.

For example, $W(144,4) = 7$. There are $7$ ways in which $144$ can
be written as a product of $4$ distinct positive integers:

-   $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 4 \times 18$
-   $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 8 \times 9$
-   $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 24$
-   $144 = 1 \times 2 \times 6 \times 12$
-   $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 4 \times 12$
-   $144 = 1 \times 3 \times 6 \times 8$
-   $144 = 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 6$

Note that permutations of the integers themselves are not considered
distinct.

Furthermore, $W(100!,10)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007 = 287549200$.

Find $W(10000!,30)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 496
===========

Given an integer sided triangle $ABC$:
Let $I$ be the incenter of $ABC$.
Let $D$ be the intersection between the line $AI$ and the
circumcircle of $ABC$ ($A \ne D$).

We define $F(L)$ as the sum of $BC$ for the triangles $ABC$ that
satisfy $AC = DI$ and $BC \le L$.

For example, $F(15) = 45$ because the triangles $ABC$ with
$(BC,AC,AB) = (6,4,5), (12,8,10), (12,9,7), (15,9,16)$ satisfy the
conditions.

Find $F(10^9)$.

Problem 497
===========

Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, \"Tower
of Hanoi,\" which consists of three upright rods and disks of different
sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack
of $n$ disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size.
The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost
rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:

1.  Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2.  A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and
    placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod).
3.  No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room $k$ units
(square tiles) wide, labeled from $1$ to $k$ in ascending order.
Three rods are placed at squares $a$, $b$, and $c$, and a stack of
$n$ disks is placed on the rod at square $a$.

Bob begins the game standing at square $b$. His objective is to play
the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square
$c$. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the
same square as the rod/stack in question.

Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either
stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal
probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he
can only move in one direction. Despite Bob\'s inebriated state, he is
still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as
choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.

The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for $n =
3$, $k = 7$, $a = 2$, $b = 4$, and $c = 6$:

![0497\_hanoi.gif](resources/images/0497_hanoi.gif?1678992057)

Let $E(n, k, a, b, c)$ be the expected number of squares that Bob
travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played
optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.

Interestingly enough, the result is always an integer. For example,
$E(2,5,1,3,5) = 60$ and $E(3,20,4,9,17) = 2358$.

Find the last nine digits of $\sum\_{1\le n \le 10000}
E(n,10^n,3^n,6^n,9^n)$.

Problem 498
===========

For positive integers $n$ and $m$, we define two polynomials
$F\_n(x) = x^n$ and $G\_m(x) = (x-1)^m$.
We also define a polynomial $R\_{n,m}(x)$ as the remainder of the
division of $F\_n(x)$ by $G\_m(x)$.
For example, $R\_{6,3}(x) = 15x^2 - 24x + 10$.

Let $C(n, m, d)$ be the absolute value of the coefficient of the
$d$-th degree term of $R\_{n,m}(x)$.
We can verify that $C(6, 3, 1) = 24$ and $C(100, 10, 4) =
227197811615775$.

Problem 499
===========

A gambler decides to participate in a special lottery. In this lottery
the gambler plays a series of one or more games.
Each game costs $m$ pounds to play and starts with an initial pot of
$1$ pound. The gambler flips an unbiased coin. Every time a head
appears, the pot is doubled and the gambler continues. When a tail
appears, the game ends and the gambler collects the current value of the
pot. The gambler is certain to win at least $1$ pound, the starting
value of the pot, at the cost of $m$ pounds, the initial fee.

The game ends if the gambler\'s fortune falls below $m$ pounds. Let
$p\_m(s)$ denote the probability that the gambler will never run out
of money in this lottery given an initial fortune $s$ and the cost per
game $m$.
For example $p\_2(2) \approx 0.2522$, $p\_2(5) \approx 0.6873$ and
$p\_6(10\,000) \approx 0.9952$ (note: $p\_m(s) = 0$ for $s \lt
m$).

We define a [block]{.dfn} to be a rectangle with a height of $1$ and
an integer-valued length. Let a [castle]{.dfn} be a configuration of
stacked blocks.

Given a game grid that is $w$ units wide and $h$ units tall, a
castle is generated according to the following rules:

1.  Blocks can be placed on top of other blocks as long as nothing
    sticks out past the edges or hangs out over open space.
2.  All blocks are aligned/snapped to the grid.
3.  Any two neighboring blocks on the same row have at least one unit of
    space between them.
4.  The bottom row is occupied by a block of length $w$.
5.  The maximum achieved height of the entire castle is exactly $h$.
6.  The castle is made from an even number of blocks.

The following is a sample castle for $w=8$ and $h=5$:

Problem 503
===========

Alice is playing a game with $n$ cards numbered $1$ to $n$.

A game consists of iterations of the following steps.
(1) Alice picks one of the cards at random.
(2) Alice cannot see the number on it. Instead, Bob, one of her friends,
sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen numbers are
bigger than the number which he is seeing.
(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the
number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is
removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left,
she is forced to end the game.

Let $F(n)$ be Alice\'s expected score if she takes the optimized
strategy to **minimize** her score.

For example, $F(3) = 5/3$. At the first iteration, she should continue
the game. At the second iteration, she should end the game if Bob says
that one previously-seen number is bigger than the number which he is
seeing, otherwise she should continue the game.

We can also verify that $F(4) = 15/8$ and $F(10) \approx
2.5579365079$.

Consider the Gaussian integer $i-1$. A **base $i-1$ representation**
of a Gaussian integer $a+bi$ is a finite sequence of digits $d\_{n -

-   Each $d\_k$ is in $\{0,1\}$
-   There are no leading zeroes, i.e. $d\_{n-1} \ne 0$, unless
    $a+bi$ is itself $0$

Here are base $i-1$ representations of a few Gaussian integers:

Remarkably, every Gaussian integer has a unique base $i-1$
representation!

representation of $a + bi$. For example, $f(11+24i) = 9$ and

Anton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.
However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the
rules somewhat.
They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a [proper
divisor[a proper divisor of $n$ is a divisor of $n$ smaller than
$n$]{.tooltiptext}]{.dfn .tooltip} of the number of stones present in
the pile.
E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains $24$ stones they may take
only $1,2,3,4,6,8$ or $12$ stones from that pile.
So if a pile contains one stone they can\'t take the last stone from it
as $1$ isn\'t a proper divisor of $1$.
The first player that can\'t make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.

The triple $(a, b, c)$ indicates the number of stones in the three
piles.

A **geoboard** (of order $N$) is a square board with equally-spaced
pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice
for coordinates $0 \le x, y \le N$.

$f(n)$ be the number of possible fountains with $n$ coins. For $4$
coins there are three possible arrangements:

::: {align="center"}
![0519\_coin\_fountain.png](resources/images/0519_coin_fountain.png?1678992053)
:::

Therefore $f(4) = 3$ while $f(10) = 78$.

Let $T(n)$ be the number of all possible colourings with three colours
for all $f(n)$ different fountains with $n$ coins, given the
condition that no two touching coins have the same colour. Below you see
the possible colourings for one of the three valid fountains for $4$
coins:

You are given that $T(4) = 48$ and $T(10) = 17760$.

Problem 520
===========

We define a [simber]{.dfn} to be a positive integer in which any odd
digit, if present, occurs an odd number of times, and any even digit, if
present, occurs an even number of times.

For example, $141221242$ is a $9$-digit simber because it has three
$1$\'s, four $2$\'s and two $4$\'s.

Let $Q(n)$ be the count of all simbers with at most $n$ digits.

You are given $Q(7) = 287975$ and $Q(100) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,123
= 123864868$.

Find $(\sum\_{1 \le u \le 39} Q(2^u)) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,123$.

Problem 521
===========

Let $\operatorname{smpf}(n)$ be the smallest prime factor of $n$.
$\operatorname{smpf}(91)=7$ because $91=7\times 13$ and
$\operatorname{smpf}(45)=3$ because $45=3\times 3\times 5$.
Let $S(n)$ be the sum of $\operatorname{smpf}(i)$ for $2 \le i
\le n$.
E.g. $S(100)=1257$.

Find $S(10^{12}) \bmod 10^9$.

Problem 522
===========

Despite the popularity of Hilbert\'s infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to
try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.

To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special
generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the
top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert
could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having
the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire
hotel.

Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they
built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to
another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert\'s freedom
to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on
certain floors.

For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:

![0522\_hilberts\_blackout.png](resources/images/0522_hilberts_blackout.png?1678992053)

If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would
receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors
instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that
while a given floor can *receive* power from many other floors at once,
it can only *send* power to one other floor.

To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal
number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it
sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can
be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor
instead of the third floor.

Let $F(n)$ be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed
over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of $n$ floors.
For example, $F(3) = 6$, $F(8) = 16276736$, and $F(100) \bmod
135707531 = 84326147$.

Find $F(12344321) \bmod 135707531$.

Problem 523
===========

Consider the following algorithm for sorting a list:

-   1\. Starting from the beginning of the list, check each pair of
    adjacent elements in turn.
-   2\. If the elements are out of order:
    -   a\. Move the smallest element of the pair at the beginning of
        the list.
    -   b\. Restart the process from step 1.
-   3\. If all pairs are in order, stop.

For example, the list $\{\,4\,1\,3\,2\,\}$ is sorted as
follows:

-   $\underline{4\,1}\,3\,2$ ($4$ and $1$ are out of order so
    move $1$ to the front of the list)
-   $1\,\underline{4\,3}\,2$ ($4$ and $3$ are out of order so
    move $3$ to the front of the list)
-   $\underline{3\,1}\,4\,2$ ($3$ and $1$ are out of order so
    move $1$ to the front of the list)
-   $1\,3\,\underline{4\,2}$ ($4$ and $2$ are out of order so
    move $2$ to the front of the list)
-   $\underline{2\,1}\,3\,4$ ($2$ and $1$ are out of order so
    move $1$ to the front of the list)
-   $1\,2\,3\,4$ (The list is now sorted)

Let $F(L)$ be the number of times step 2a is executed to sort list
$L$. For example, $F(\{\,4\,1\,3\,2\,\}) = 5$.

Let $E(n)$ be the **expected value** of $F(P)$ over all permutations
$P$ of the integers $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.
You are given $E(4) = 3.25$ and $E(10) = 115.725$.

Find $E(30)$. Give your answer rounded to two digits after the decimal
point.

Consider the following algorithm for sorting a list:

Let $F(L)$ be the number of times step 2a is executed to sort list
$L$. For example, $F(\{\,4\,1\,3\,2\,\}) = 5$.

We can list all permutations $P$ of the integers $\{1, 2, \dots,
n\}$ in **lexicographical order**, and assign to each permutation an
index $I\_n(P)$ from $1$ to $n!$ corresponding to its position in
the list.

Let $Q(n, k) = \min(I\_n(P))$ for $F(P) = k$, the index of the
first permutation requiring exactly $k$ steps to sort with First Sort.
If there is no permutation for which $F(P) = k$, then $Q(n, k)$ is
undefined.

For $n = 4$ we have:

  `P`{.variable}   `I`{.variable}~4~(`P`{.variable})   `F`{.variable}(`P`{.variable})

An ellipse $E(a, b)$ is given at its initial position by equation:
$\frac {x^2} {a^2} + \frac {(y - b)^2} {b^2} = 1$

The ellipse rolls without slipping along the $x$ axis for one complete
turn. Interestingly, the length of the curve generated by a focus is
independent from the size of the minor axis:

Problem 527
===========

A secret integer $t$ is selected at random within the range $1 \le t
\le n$.

The goal is to guess the value of $t$ by making repeated guesses, via
integer $g$. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes,
in which it will be revealed that either $g \lt t$, $g = t$, or $g
\gt t$. Then the process can repeat as necessary.

Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized
with a binary search: Given a lower bound $L$ and upper bound $H$
(initialized to $L = 1$ and $H = n$), let $g =
\lfloor(L+H)/2\rfloor$ where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the
integer floor function. If $g = t$, the process ends. Otherwise, if
$g \lt t$, set $L = g+1$, but if $g \gt t$ instead, set $H = g
- 1$. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and
ultimately ends once $t$ is found. Even if $t$ can be deduced
without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to
confirm the value.

Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that
much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting $g =
\lfloor(L+H)/2\rfloor$, simply let $g$ be a random integer between
$L$ and $H$, inclusive. The rest of the algorithm is the same as the
standard binary search. This new search routine will be referred to as a
[random binary search]{.dfn}.

Given that $1 \le t \le n$ for random $t$, let $B(n)$ be the
expected number of guesses needed to find $t$ using the standard
binary search, and let $R(n)$ be the expected number of guesses needed
to find $t$ using the random binary search. For example, $B(6) =
2.33333333$ and $R(6) = 2.71666667$ when rounded to $8$ decimal
places.

Find $R(10^{10}) - B(10^{10})$ rounded to $8$ decimal places.

A [$10$-substring]{.dfn} of a number is a substring of its digits that

Problem 532
===========

Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by
giving them a ball coloured by his new nanobots as a present.

His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other
bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the
shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while
moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their
selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball,
they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path.
However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust
their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All
bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation
until each bot reaches its goal.

Now Bob places $n$ bots on the ball (with radius $1$) equidistantly
on a small circle with radius $0.999$ and programs each of them to
move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small
circle. After activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they
finally meet at one point on the ball.

Using three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length
$2.84$, resulting in a total length of $8.52$ for all three bots,
each time rounded to two decimal places. The coloured ball looks like
this:

$1000$. What is the total length of all lines drawn with this number
of bots, rounded to two decimal places?

Problem 534
===========

The classical **eight queens puzzle** is the well known problem of
placing eight chess queens on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard so that no
two queens threaten each other. Allowing configurations to reappear in
rotated or mirrored form, a total of $92$ distinct configurations can
be found for eight queens. The general case asks for the number of
distinct ways of placing $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ board, e.g.
you can find $2$ distinct configurations for $n=4$.

Let\'s define a [weak queen]{.dfn} on an $n \times n$ board to be a
piece which can move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a
maximum of $n - 1 - w$ squares if moved vertically or diagonally, $0
\le w \lt n$ being the \"weakness factor\". For example, a weak queen
on an $n \times n$ board with a weakness factor of $w=1$ located in
the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as
the weak queen would need to move $n - 1$ squares vertically or
diagonally to get there, but may only move $n - 2$ squares in these
directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally,
thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its
current position in that row.

Let $Q(n,w)$ be the number of ways $n$ weak queens with weakness
factor $w$ can be placed on an $n \times n$ board so that no two
queens threaten each other. It can be shown, for example, that
$Q(4,0)=2$, $Q(4,2)=16$ and $Q(4,3)=256$.

Let $S(n)=\displaystyle\sum\_{w=0}^{n-1} Q(n,w)$.

You are given that $S(4)=276$ and $S(5)=3347$.

Find $S(14)$.

The sequence is characterized by the following properties:

-   The circled numbers are consecutive integers starting with $1$.
-   Immediately preceding each non-circled numbers $a\_i$, there are
    exactly $\lfloor \sqrt{a\_i} \rfloor$ adjacent circled numbers,
    where $\lfloor\,\rfloor$ is the floor function.
-   If we remove all circled numbers, the remaining numbers form a
    sequence identical to $S$, so $S$ is a **fractal sequence**.

Consider a positive integer sequence $S = (s\_1, s\_2, \dots, s\_n)$.

Let $f(S)$ be the perimeter of the maximum-area quadrilateral whose
side lengths are $4$ elements $(s\_i, s\_j, s\_k, s\_l)$ of $S$
(all $i, j, k, l$ distinct). If there are many quadrilaterals with the
same maximum area, then choose the one with the largest perimeter.

For example, if $S = (8, 9, 14, 9, 27)$, then we can take the elements
$(9, 14, 9, 27)$ and form an **isosceles trapezium[An isosceles

$27$ and both leg lengths $9$. The area of this quadrilateral is
$127.611470879\cdots$ It can be shown that this is the largest area
for any quadrilateral that can be formed using side lengths from $S$.
Therefore, $f(S) = 9 + 14 + 9 + 27 = 59$.

Let $u\_n = 2^{B(3n)} + 3^{B(2n)} + B(n + 1)$, where $B(k)$ is the

For example, $B(6) = 2$, $B(10) = 2$ and $B(15) = 4$, and $u\_5 =
2^4 + 3^2 + 2 = 27$.

Also, let $U\_n$ be the sequence $(u\_1, u\_2, \dots, u\_n)$.
For example, $U\_{10} = (8, 9, 14, 9, 27, 16, 36, 9, 27, 28)$.

It can be shown that $f(U\_5) = 59$, $f(U\_{10}) = 118$,
$f(U\_{150}) = 3223$.
It can also be shown that $\sum f(U\_n) = 234761$ for $4 \le n \le

Define function $P(n, k) = 1$ if $n$ can be written as the sum of
$k$ prime numbers (with repetitions allowed), and $P(n, k) = 0$
otherwise.

For example, $P(10,2) = 1$ because $10$ can be written as either $3

$11$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all $P(i,k)$ over $1 \le i,k \le n$.

a\_{i} n^i = a\_{1} n + a\_{2} n^2 + \... + a\_{k} n^k + a\_{k+1}
n^{k + 1}$,
where $a\_i$\'s are rational coefficients that can be written as
reduced fractions $p\_i/q\_i$ (if $a\_i = 0$, we shall consider
$q\_i = 1$).

For example, $1^4 + 2^4 + \... + n^4 = -\frac 1 {30} n + \frac 1 3
n^3 + \frac 1 2 n^4 + \frac 1 5 n^5.$

Problem 547
===========

Assuming that two points are chosen randomly (with **uniform
distribution**) within a rectangle, it is possible to determine the
**expected value** of the distance between these two points.

For example, the expected distance between two random points in a unit
square is about $0.521405$, while the expected distance between two
random points in a rectangle with side lengths $2$ and $3$ is about
$1.317067$.

Now we define a [hollow square lamina]{.dfn} of size $n$ to be an
integer sized square with side length $n \ge 3$ consisting of
$n^2$ unit squares from which a rectangle consisting of $x \times
y$ unit squares ($1 \le x,y \le n - 2$) within the original square
has been removed.

For $n = 3$ there exists only one hollow square lamina:

![0547-holes-1.png](resources/images/0547-holes-1.png?1678992053)

For $n = 4$ you can find $9$ distinct hollow square laminae,
allowing shapes to reappear in rotated or mirrored form:

![0547-holes-2.png](resources/images/0547-holes-2.png?1678992053)

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the expected distance between two points
chosen randomly within each of the possible hollow square laminae of
size $n$. The two points have to lie within the area left after
removing the inner rectangle, i.e. the gray-colored areas in the
illustrations above.

For example, $S(3) = 1.6514$ and $S(4) = 19.6564$, rounded to four
digits after the decimal point.

Find $S(40)$ rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

Two players are playing a game, alternating turns. There are $k$ piles
of stones. On each turn, a player has to choose a pile and replace it
with two piles of stones under the following two conditions:

-   Both new piles must have a number of stones more than one and less
    than the number of stones of the original pile.
-   The number of stones of each of the new piles must be a divisor of
    the number of stones of the original pile.

The first player unable to make a valid move loses.

Let $A\_n$ be the smallest positive integer satisfying $A\_n \bmod
p\_i = i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$, where $p\_i$ is the $i$-th
prime.
For example $A\_2 = 5$, since this is the smallest positive solution
of the system of equations

-   $A\_2 \bmod 2 = 1$
-   $A\_2 \bmod 3 = 2$

The system of equations for $A\_3$ adds another constraint. That is,
$A\_3$ is the smallest positive solution of

-   $A\_3 \bmod 2 = 1$
-   $A\_3 \bmod 3 = 2$
-   $A\_3 \bmod 5 = 3$

and hence $A\_3 = 23$. Similarly, one gets $A\_4 = 53$ and $A\_5 =
1523$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all primes up to $n$ that divide at least
one element in the sequence $A$.
For example, $S(50) = 69 = 5 + 23 + 41$, since $5$ divides $A\_2$,
$23$ divides $A\_3$ and $41$ divides $A\_{10} = 5765999453$. No

Let $Q(n)$ be the set of all the non-empty subsets of $P(n)$.
Let $R(n)$ be the set of all the non-empty subsets of $Q(n)$.

An element $X \in R(n)$ is a non-empty subset of $Q(n)$, so it is
itself a set.
From $X$ we can construct a graph as follows:

-   Each element $Y \in X$ corresponds to a vertex and labeled with
    $Y$;
-   Two vertices $Y\_1$ and $Y\_2$ are connected if $Y\_1 \cap

The McCarthy 91 function is defined as follows: $$ M\_{91}(n) =
\begin{cases} n - 10 & \text{if } n \> 100 \\ M\_{91}(M\_{91}(n+11))
& \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq 100 \end{cases} $$

We can generalize this definition by abstracting away the constants into
new variables: $$ M\_{m,k,s}(n) = \begin{cases} n - s & \text{if } n
\> m \\ M\_{m,k,s}(M\_{m,k,s}(n+k)) & \text{if } 0 \leq n \leq m
\end{cases} $$

This way, we have $M\_{91} = M\_{100,11,10}$.

Let $F\_{m,k,s}$ be the set of fixed points of $M\_{m,k,s}$. That
is, $$F\_{m,k,s}= \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \, \| \,
M\_{m,k,s}(n) = n \right\}$$

For example, the only fixed point of $M\_{91}$ is $n = 91$. In other
words, $F\_{100,11,10}= \{91\}$.

Now, define $SF(m,k,s)$ as the sum of the elements in $F\_{m,k,s}$
and let $S(p,m) = \displaystyle \sum\_{1 \leq s \< k \leq
p}{SF(m,k,s)}$.

Problem 556
===========

A **Gaussian integer** is a number $z = a + bi$ where $a$, $b$ are
integers and $i^2 = -1$.
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers
are the subset of Gaussian integers for which $b = 0$.

A Gaussian integer **unit** is one for which $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, i.e.
one of $1, i, -1, -i$.
Let\'s define a [proper]{.dfn} Gaussian integer as one for which $a
\gt 0$ and $b \ge 0$.

A Gaussian integer $z\_1 = a\_1 + b\_1 i$ is said to be divisible by
$z\_2 = a\_2 + b\_2 i$ if $z\_3 = a\_3 + b\_3 i = z\_1 / z\_2$ is a
Gaussian integer.
$\frac {z\_1} {z\_2} = \frac {a\_1 + b\_1 i} {a\_2 + b\_2 i} = \frac
{(a\_1 + b\_1 i)(a\_2 - b\_2 i)} {(a\_2 + b\_2 i)(a\_2 - b\_2 i)} =
\frac {a\_1 a\_2 + b\_1 b\_2} {a\_2^2 + b\_2^2} + \frac {a\_2 b\_1 -
a\_1 b\_2} {a\_2^2 + b\_2^2}i = a\_3 + b\_3 i$
So, $z\_1$ is divisible by $z\_2$ if $\frac {a\_1 a\_2 + b\_1
b\_2} {a\_2^2 + b\_2^2}$ and $\frac {a\_2 b\_1 - a\_1 b\_2}
{a\_2^2 + b\_2^2}$ are integers.
For example, $2$ is divisible by $1 + i$ because $2/(1 + i) = 1 -
i$ is a Gaussian integer.

A **Gaussian prime** is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a
unit, itself or itself times a unit.
For example, $1 + 2i$ is a Gaussian prime, because it is only
divisible by $1$, $i$, $-1$, $-i$, $1 + 2i$, $i(1 + 2i) = i -
2$, $-(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i$ and $-i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i$.
$2$ is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by $1 + i$.

A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and
proper Gaussian primes.
For example $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i)$.
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization
does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.
So $2$ is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but $1 + 3i$
is.
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.

Let $f(n)$ be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with
$a^2 + b^2 \le n$.
For example $f(10) = 7$ because $1$, $1 + i$, $1 + 2i$, $1 + 3i
= (1 + i)(2 + i)$, $2 + i$, $3$ and $3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i)$
are squarefree, while $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$ and $2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)^3$
are not.
You are given $f(10^2) = 54$, $f(10^4) = 5218$ and $f(10^8) =
52126906$.

Find $f(10^{14})$.

Problem 557

A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting
at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming
three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral. If the original
triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such
that all of the four pieces also have integral area. For example, the
diagram below shows a triangle of area $55$ that has been cut in this
way.

Representing the areas as $a, b, c$ and $d$, in the example above,
the individual areas are $a = 22$, $b = 8$, $c = 11$ and $d =

Define a triangle cutting quadruple $(a, b, c, d)$ as a valid integral
division of a triangle, where $a$ is the area of the triangle between
the two cut vertices, $d$ is the area of the quadrilateral and $b$

For example, $3 = r^{-10} + r^{-5} + r^{-1} + r^2$ and $10 =
r^{-10} + r^{-7} + r^6$.
Interestingly, the relation holds for the complex roots of the equation.

Let $w(n)$ be the number of terms in this unique representation of
$n$. Thus $w(3) = 4$ and $w(10) = 3$.

More formally, for all positive integers $n$, we have:
$n = \displaystyle \sum\_{k=-\infty}^\infty b\_k r^k$
under the conditions that:
$b\_k$ is $0$ or $1$ for all $k$;
$b\_k + b\_{k + 1} + b\_{k + 2} \le 1$ for all $k$;
$w(n) = \displaystyle \sum\_{k=-\infty}^\infty b\_k$ is finite.

Let $S(m) = \displaystyle \sum\_{j=1}^m w(j^2)$.
You are given $S(10) = 61$ and $S(1000) = 19403$.

Find $S(5\,000\,000)$.

An [ascent]{.dfn} of a column $j$ in a matrix occurs if the value of
column $j$ is smaller than the value of column $j + 1$ in all rows.

Let $P(k, r, n)$ be the number of $r \times n$ matrices with the
following properties:

-   The rows are permutations of $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$.
-   Numbering the first column as $1$, a column ascent occurs at
    column $j \lt n$ **if and only if** $j$ is not a multiple of
    $k$.

For example, $P(1, 2, 3) = 19$, $P(2, 4, 6) = 65508751$ and $P(7,
5, 30) \bmod 1000000123 = 161858102$.

Let $Q(n) = \displaystyle \sum\_{k=1}^n P(k, n, n)$.

Coprime Nim is just like ordinary normal play Nim, but the players may
only remove a number of stones from a pile that is **coprime** with the
current size of the pile. Two players remove stones in turn. The player
who removes the last stone wins.

Let $L(n, k)$ be the number of **losing** starting positions for the
first player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with $k$
piles, each having between $1$ and $n - 1$ stones inclusively.

For example, $L(5, 2) = 6$ since the losing initial positions are
$(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, $(2, 4)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 2)$ and $(4,
4)$.
You are also given $L(10, 5) = 9964$, $L(10, 10) = 472400303$,

Let $S(n)$ be the number of pairs $(a,b)$ of distinct divisors of
$n$ such that $a$ divides $b$.
For $n=6$ we get the following pairs: $(1,2), (1,3), (1,6),( 2,6)$
and $(3,6)$. So $S(6)=5$.
Let $p\_m\\#$ be the product of the first $m$ prime numbers, so
$p\_2\\# = 2\*3 = 6$.
Let $E(m, n)$ be the highest integer $k$ such that $2^k$ divides
$S((p\_m\\#)^n)$.
$E(2,1) = 0$ since $2^0$ is the highest power of 2 that divides
S(6)=5.

Problem 563
===========

A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets,
starting from unit square metal plates. The welding is performed by a
range of robots of increasing size. Unfortunately, the programming
options of these robots are rather limited. Each one can only process up
to $25$ identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along
either edge to produce a larger rectangle. The only programmable
variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and
including $25$), and whether to weld the long or short edge.

For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together $11$
raw unit square plates to make a $11 \times 1$ strip. The next could
take $10$ of these $11 \times 1$ strips, and weld them either to
make a longer $110 \times 1$ strip, or a $11 \times 10$ rectangle.
Many, but not all, possible dimensions of metal sheets can be
constructed in this way.

One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished
product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more
than $10\%$ larger than the short side. If these requirements can be
met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two
sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For
example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area $889200$, then
there are three final dimensions that can be produced: $900 \times
988$, $912 \times 975$ and $936 \times 950$. The target area of
$889200$ is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three
different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.

Let $M(n)$ be the minimal area that can be manufactured in
[exactly]{.underline} $n$ variants with the longer edge not greater
than $10\%$ bigger than the shorter edge. Hence $M(3) = 889200$.

Find $\sum\_{n=2}^{100} M(n)$.

Problem 564
===========

A line segment of length $2n-3$ is randomly split into $n$ segments
of integer length ($n \ge 3$). In the sequence given by this split,
the segments are then used as consecutive sides of a convex
$n$-polygon, formed in such a way that its area is maximal. All of the
$\binom{2n-4} {n-1}$ possibilities for splitting up the initial line
segment occur with the same probability.

Let $E(n)$ be the expected value of the area that is obtained by this
procedure.
For example, for $n=3$ the only possible split of the line segment of
length $3$ results in three line segments with length $1$, that form
an equilateral triangle with an area of $\frac 1 4 \sqrt{3}$.
Therefore $E(3)=0.433013$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.
For $n=4$ you can find $4$ different possible splits, each of which
is composed of three line segments with length $1$ and one line
segment with length $2$. All of these splits lead to the same maximal
quadrilateral with an area of $\frac 3 4 \sqrt{3}$, thus
$E(4)=1.299038$, rounded to $6$ decimal places.

Let $S(k)=\displaystyle \sum\_{n=3}^k E(n)$.
For example, $S(3)=0.433013$, $S(4)=1.732051$, $S(5)=4.604767$ and
$S(10)=66.955511$, rounded to $6$ decimal places each.

The numbers $n$ not exceeding $20$ such that $7$ divides
$\sigma(n)$ are: $4$, $12$, $13$ and $20$, the sum of these
numbers being $49$.

Let $S(n, d)$ be the sum of the numbers $i$ not exceeding $n$ such
that $d$ divides $\sigma(i)$.
So $S(20 , 7)=49$.

You are given: $S(10^6,2017)=150850429$ and $S(10^9,

Adam plays the following game with his birthday cake.

He cuts a piece forming a circular sector of $60$ degrees and flips
the piece upside down, with the icing on the bottom.
He then rotates the cake by $60$ degrees counterclockwise, cuts an
adjacent $60$ degree piece and flips it upside down.
He keeps repeating this, until after a total of twelve steps, all the
icing is back on top.

Amazingly, this works for any piece size, even if the cutting angle is
an irrational number: all the icing will be back on top after a finite
number of steps.

Now, Adam tries something different: he alternates cutting pieces of
size $x=\frac{360}{9}$ degrees, $y=\frac{360}{10}$ degrees and
$z=\frac{360 }{\sqrt{11}}$ degrees. The first piece he cuts has size
$x$ and he flips it. The second has size $y$ and he flips it. The
third has size $z$ and he flips it. He repeats this with pieces of
size $x$, $y$ and $z$ in that order until all the icing is back on
top, and discovers he needs $60$ flips altogether.

Problem 567

Tom has built a random generator that is connected to a row of $n$
light bulbs. Whenever the random generator is activated each of the
$n$ lights is turned on with the probability of $\frac 1 2$,
independently of its former state or the state of the other light bulbs.

While discussing with his friend Jerry how to use his generator, they
invent two different games, they call the [reciprocal games]{.dfn}:
Both games consist of $n$ turns. Each turn is started by choosing a
number $k$ randomly between (and including) $1$ and $n$, with
equal probability of $\frac 1 n$ for each number, while the possible
win for that turn is the reciprocal of $k$, that is $\frac 1 k$.

In game A, Tom activates his random generator once in each turn. If the
number of lights turned on is the same as the previously chosen number
$k$, Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive
nothing for that turn. Jerry\'s expected win after playing the total
game A consisting of $n$ turns is called $J\_A(n)$. For example
$J\_A(6)=0.39505208$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.

For each turn in game B, after $k$ has been randomly selected, Tom
keeps reactivating his random generator until exactly $k$ lights are
turned on. After that Jerry takes over and reactivates the random
generator until he, too, has generated a pattern with exactly $k$
lights turned on. If this pattern is identical to Tom\'s last pattern,
Jerry wins and gets $\frac 1 k$, otherwise he will receive nothing.
Jerry\'s expected win after the total game B consisting of $n$ turns

$n$ runners in very different training states want to compete in a
race. Each one of them is given a different starting number $k$
$(1\leq k \leq n)$ according to the runner\'s (constant) individual
racing speed being $v\_k=\frac{k}{n}$.
In order to give the slower runners a chance to win the race, $n$
different starting positions are chosen randomly (with uniform
distribution) and independently from each other within the racing track
of length $1$. After this, the starting position nearest to the goal
is assigned to runner $1$, the next nearest starting position to
runner $2$ and so on, until finally the starting position furthest
away from the goal is assigned to runner $n$. The winner of the race
is the runner who reaches the goal first.

Interestingly, the expected running time for the winner is
$\frac{1}{2}$, independently of the number of runners. Moreover,
while it can be shown that all runners will have the same expected
running time of $\frac{n}{n+1}$, the race is still unfair, since the
winning chances may differ significantly for different starting numbers:

Let $P\_{n,k}$ be the probability for runner $k$ to win a race with
$n$ runners and $E\_n = \sum\_{k=1}^n k P\_{n,k}$ be the expected
starting number of the winner in that race. It can be shown that, for
example, $P\_{3,1}=\frac{4}{9}$, $P\_{3,2}=\frac{2}{9}$,
$P\_{3,3}=\frac{1}{3}$ and $E\_3=\frac{17}{9}$ for a race with
$3$ runners.
You are given that $E\_4=2.21875$, $E\_5=2.5104$ and

Let $q$ be a prime and $A \ge B \>0$ be two integers with the
following properties:

-   $A$ and $B$ have no prime factor in common, that is
    $\gcd(A,B)=1$.
-   The product $AB$ is divisible by every prime less than q.

It can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B\<q^2$ and
any difference $1\<A-B\<q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can
verify that a number $p$ is prime by showing that either
$p=A+B\<q^2$ or $p=A-B\<q^2$ for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the
conditions listed above.

Let $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum
$p=A+B$ and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime.
Examples:
$V(2)=1$, since $2=1+1\< 2^2$.
$V(37)=22$, since $37=22+15=2 \cdot 11+3 \cdot 5\< 7^2$ is the
associated sum with the smallest possible $A$.
$V(151)=165$ since $151=165-14=3 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 - 2 \cdot
7\<13^2$ is the associated difference with the smallest possible
$A$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of $V(p)$ for all primes $p\<n$. For
example, $S(10)=10$ and $S(200)=7177$.

Find $S(3800)$.

Problem 575
===========

It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as
if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response
it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included.
Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure,
Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.

She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission
was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power
and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe,
and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with
his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful
computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through
a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that
the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So,
for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the
rooms would be numbered in the following way.

::: {.center}
![p575\_wandering\_robot\_1\_5x5.png](project/images/p575_wandering_robot_1_5x5.png)
:::

Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the
answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be
worthy of such knowledge.

Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given
instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the
same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear
to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally
between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or,
(ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then
the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available
routes.

\(ii\) Fixed 50% probability of remaining
:::
:::

The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean
that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number
of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a
fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately
there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further
information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of
either of the choices being implemented.

Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that
the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5
grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately
0.177976190476 \[12 d.p.\].

In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must
calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in
the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.

Any positive integer can be written as a product of prime powers:
$p\_1^{a\_1} \times p\_2^{a\_2} \times \cdots \times
p\_k^{a\_k}$,
where $p\_i$ are distinct prime integers, $a\_i \gt 0$ and $p\_i
\lt p\_j$ if $i \lt j$.

A [decreasing prime power]{.dfn} positive integer is one for which
$a\_i \ge a\_j$ if $i \lt j$.
For example, $1$, $2$, $15=3 \times 5$, $360=2^3 \times 3^2
\times 5$ and $1000=2^3 \times 5^3$ are decreasing prime power
integers.

Let $C(n)$ be the count of decreasing prime power positive integers
not exceeding $n$.
$C(100) = 94$ since all positive integers not exceeding $100$ have
decreasing prime powers except $18$, $50$, $54$, $75$, $90$
and $98$.
You are given $C(10^6) = 922052$.

Find $C(10^{13})$.

Problem 579
===========

A **lattice cube** is a cube in which all vertices have integer
coordinates. Let $C(n)$ be the number of different lattice cubes in
which the coordinates of all vertices range between (and including)
$0$ and $n$. Two cubes are hereby considered different if any of
their vertices have different coordinates.
For example, $C(1)=1$, $C(2)=9$, $C(4)=100$, $C(5)=229$,
$C(10)=4469$ and $C(50)=8154671$.

Different cubes may contain different numbers of lattice points.

For example, the cube with the vertices
$(0, 0, 0)$, $(3, 0, 0)$, $(0, 3, 0)$, $(0, 0, 3)$, $(0, 3,
3)$, $(3, 0, 3)$, $(3, 3, 0)$, $(3, 3, 3)$ contains $64$
lattice points ($56$ lattice points on the surface including the $8$
vertices and $8$ points within the cube).

In contrast, the cube with the vertices
$(0, 2, 2)$, $(1, 4, 4)$, $(2, 0, 3)$, $(2, 3, 0)$, $(3, 2,
5)$, $(3, 5, 2)$, $(4, 1, 1)$, $(5, 3, 3)$ contains only $40$
lattice points ($20$ points on the surface and $20$ points within
the cube), although both cubes have the same side length $3$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of the lattice points contained in the different
lattice cubes in which the coordinates of all vertices range between
(and including) $0$ and $n$.

For example, $S(1)=8$, $S(2)=91$, $S(4)=1878$, $S(5)=5832$,
$S(10)=387003$ and $S(50)=29948928129$.

Find $S(5000) \bmod 10^9$.

Problem 580
===========

A **Hilbert number** is any positive integer of the form $4k+1$ for
integer $k\geq 0$. We shall define a *squarefree Hilbert number* as a
Hilbert number which is not divisible by the square of any Hilbert
number other than one. For example, $117$ is a squarefree Hilbert
number, equaling $9\times13$. However $6237$ is a Hilbert number
that is not squarefree in this sense, as it is divisible by $9^2$.
The number $3969$ is also not squarefree, as it is divisible by both
$9^2$ and $21^2$.

There are $2327192$ squarefree Hilbert numbers below $10^7$.
How many squarefree Hilbert numbers are there below $10^{16}$?

Problem 581
===========

A number is $p$-smooth if it has no prime factors larger than $p$.
Let $T$ be the sequence of triangular numbers, i.e.
$T(n)=n(n+1)/2$.
Find the sum of all indices $n$ such that $T(n)$ is $47$-smooth.

Problem 582
===========

Let $a, b$ and $c$ be the sides of an integer sided triangle with
one angle of $120$ degrees, $a \le b \le c$ and $b-a \le 100$.
Let $T(n)$ be the number of such triangles with $c \le n$.
$T(1000)=235$ and $T(10^8)=1245$.
Find $T(10^{100})$.

Problem 583
===========

A standard envelope shape is a convex figure consisting of an isosceles
triangle (the flap) placed on top of a rectangle. An example of an
envelope with integral sides is shown below. Note that to form a
sensible envelope, the perpendicular height of the flap ($BCD$) must
be smaller than the height of the rectangle ($ABDE$).

::: {.center}
![0583\_heron\_envelope.gif](resources/images/0583_heron_envelope.gif?1678992057)
:::

In the envelope illustrated, not only are all the sides integral, but
also all the diagonals ($AC$, $AD$, $BD$, $BE$ and $CE$) are
integral too. Let us call an envelope with these properties a [Heron
envelope]{.dfn}.

Let $S(p)$ be the sum of the perimeters of all the Heron envelopes
with a perimeter less than or equal to $p$.

You are given that $S(10^4) = 884680$. Find $S(10^7)$.

Problem 584
===========

A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants
of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their
planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the
answer for the so called \"**Birthday Problem**\". The description of
the problem was as follows:

*If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one,
what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first
find **3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other**.*

The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the
device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of
events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on
Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely
birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and
found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians
entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.

After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka.
The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had
changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:

*If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one,
what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first
find **3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other**.*

With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka)
found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because
the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming
equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device
and launched the drone into space again.

This time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in the
problem description had changed. It read:

*If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one,
what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first
find **4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other**.*

What would be the answer (rounded to eight places after the decimal
point) the people of Earth have to enter into the device for a year with
365 days? Ignore leap years. Also assume that all birthdays are equally
likely and independent of each other.

Problem 585
===========

Consider the term $\small \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$ that is
representing a **nested square root**. $x$, $y$ and $z$ are
positive integers and $y$ and $z$ are not allowed to be perfect
squares, so the number below the outer square root is irrational. Still
it can be shown that for some combinations of $x$, $y$ and $z$ the
given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of simple
square roots of integers, actually **denesting** the square roots in the
initial expression.

Here are some examples of this denesting:
$\small
\sqrt{3+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{1}=\sqrt{2}+1$
$\small \sqrt{8+\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{15}}=\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{3}$
$\small
\sqrt{20+\sqrt{96}+\sqrt{12}}=\sqrt{9}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}=3+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}$
$\small
\sqrt{28+\sqrt{160}+\sqrt{108}}=\sqrt{15}+\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{5}-\sqrt{2}$

As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be
perfect squares resulting in further simplification.

Let F($n$) be the number of different terms $\small
\sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}$, that can be denested into the sum
and/or difference of a finite number of square roots, given the
additional condition that $0\<x \le n$. That is,
$\small \displaystyle \sqrt{x+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z}}=\sum\_{i=1}^k
s\_i\sqrt{a\_i}$
with $k$, $x$, $y$, $z$ and all $a\_i$ being positive
integers, all $s\_i =\pm 1$ and $x\le n$.
Furthermore $y$ and $z$ are not allowed to be perfect squares.

Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for
example $\small \sqrt{7+\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{27}}$, $\small
\sqrt{7+\sqrt{12}+\sqrt{12}}$ and $\small
\sqrt{7+\sqrt{27}+\sqrt{3}}$, that can all three be denested into
$\small 2+\sqrt{3}$, would only be counted once.

You are given that $F(10)=17$, $F(15)=46$, $F(20)=86$,
$F(30)=213$ and $F(100)=2918$ and $F(5000)=11134074$.
Find $F(5000000)$.

Problem 586
===========

The number $209$ can be expressed as $a^2 + 3ab + b^2$ in two
distinct ways:

$ \qquad 209 = 8^2 + 3\cdot 8\cdot 5 + 5^2$
$ \qquad 209 = 13^2 + 3\cdot13\cdot 1 + 1^2$

Let $f(n,r)$ be the number of integers $k$ not exceeding $n$ that
can be expressed as $k=a^2 + 3ab + b^2$, with $a \gt b \gt 0$
integers, in exactly $r$ different ways.

You are given that $f(10^5, 4) = 237$ and $f(10^8, 6) = 59517$.

Find $f(10^{15}, 40)$.

Problem 587
===========

A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on the
left.
We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.
A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as
shown in the diagram on the right.
We shall call the orange shaded region a [concave triangle]{.dfn}.

::: {.center}
![0587\_concave\_triangle\_1.png](resources/images/0587_concave_triangle_1.png?1678992053){.dark_img}
:::

It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of
the L-section.

Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is
drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to
the top right as shown in the diagram below.

::: {.center}
![0587\_concave\_triangle\_2.png](resources/images/0587_concave_triangle_2.png?1678992053){.dark_img}
:::

This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the
L-section.

If $n$ circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle
is drawn around the `n`{.variable} circles, and a line is drawn from the
bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value
of `n`{.variable} for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10%
of the L-section is $n = 15$.

What is the least value of $n$ for which the concave triangle occupies
less than 0.1% of the L-section?

Problem 588
===========

The coefficients in the expansion of $(x+1)^k$ are called **binomial
coefficients**.
Analoguously the coefficients in the expansion of
$(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^k$ are called **quintinomial coefficients**.
(quintus= Latin for fifth).

Consider the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^3$:
$x^{12}+3x^{11}+6x^{10}+10x^9+15x^8+18x^7+19x^6+18x^5+15x^4+10x^3+6x^2+3x+1$
As we can see $7$ out of the $13$ quintinomial coefficients for
$k=3$ are odd.

Let $Q(k)$ be the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of
$(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^k$.
So $Q(3)=7$.

You are given $Q(10)=17$ and $Q(100)=35$.

Find $\sum\_{k=1}^{18}Q(10^k)$.

Problem 589
===========

Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that
they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before
one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as
normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of
a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges
on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water,
and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends
when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other
one having also \'lapped\' the other stick - that is, having made one
additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.

On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick
to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a
maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water
and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current
under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks\' journey time
is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to
emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds
(inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected
time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal
places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for
the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under
the bridge having lapped the other.

The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property
that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the
integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive. Let the
expected time of play in seconds be $E(m,n)$. Hence
$E(60,30)=1036.15\...$

Let $S(k)=\sum\_{m=2}^k\sum\_{n=1}^{m-1}E(m,n)$.

For example $S(5)=7722.82$ rounded to 2 decimal places.

Find $S(100)$ and give your answer rounded to 2 decimal places.

Problem 590
===========

Let $H(n)$ denote the number of sets of positive integers such that
the **least common multiple** of the integers in the set equals $n$.
E.g.:
The integers in the following ten sets all have a least common multiple
of $6$:
$\{2,3\}$, $\{1,2,3\}$, $\{6\}$, $\{1,6\}$,
$\{2,6\}$, $\{1,2,6\}$, $\{3,6\}$, $\{1,3,6\}$,
$\{2,3,6\}$ and $\{1,2,3,6\}$.
Thus $H(6)=10$.

Let $L(n)$ denote the least common multiple of the numbers $1$
through $n$.
E.g. $L(6)$ is the least common multiple of the numbers
$1,2,3,4,5,6$ and $L(6)$ equals $60$.

Let $HL(n)$ denote $H(L(n))$.
You are given $HL(4)=H(12)=44$.

Find $HL(50000)$. Give your answer modulo $10^9$.

Problem 591
===========

Given a non-square integer $d$, any real $x$ can be approximated
arbitrarily close by **quadratic integers** $a+b\sqrt{d}$, where
$a,b$ are integers. For example, the following inequalities
approximate $\pi$ with precision $10^{-13}$:
$$4375636191520\sqrt{2}-6188084046055 \< \pi \<
721133315582\sqrt{2}-1019836515172 $$
We call $BQA\_d(x,n)$ the quadratic integer closest to $x$ with the
absolute values of $a,b$ not exceeding $n$.
We also define the integral part of a quadratic integer as
$I\_d(a+b\sqrt{d}) = a$.

You are given that:

-   $BQA\_2(\pi,10) = 6 - 2\sqrt{2}$
-   $BQA\_5(\pi,100)=26\sqrt{5}-55$
-   $BQA\_7(\pi,10^6)=560323 - 211781\sqrt{7}$
-   $I\_2(BQA\_2(\pi,10^{13}))=-6188084046055$

Find the sum of $\|I\_d(BQA\_d(\pi,10^{13}))\|$ for all non-square
positive integers less than 100.

Problem 592
===========

For any $N$, let $f(N)$ be the last twelve hexadecimal digits before
the trailing zeroes in $N!$.

For example, the hexadecimal representation of $20!$ is
21C3677C82B40000,
so $f(20)$ is the digit sequence 21C3677C82B4.

Find $f(20!)$. Give your answer as twelve hexadecimal digits, using
uppercase for the digits A to F.

Problem 593
===========

We define two sequences $S = \{S(1), S(2), \..., S(n)\}$ and $S\_2
= \{S\_2(1), S\_2(2), \..., S\_2(n)\}$:

$S(k) = (p\_k)^k \bmod 10007$ where $p\_k$ is the $k$th prime
number.

$S\_2(k) = S(k) + S(\lfloor\frac{k}{10000}\rfloor + 1)$ where
$\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ denotes the floor function.

Then let $M(i, j)$ be the median of elements $S\_2(i)$ through
$S\_2(j)$, inclusive. For example, $M(1, 10) = 2021.5$ and
$M(10^2, 10^3) = 4715.0$.

Let $F(n, k) = \sum\_{i=1}^{n-k+1} M(i, i + k - 1)$. For example,
$F(100, 10) = 463628.5$ and $F(10^5, 10^4) = 675348207.5$.

Find $F(10^7, 10^5)$. If the sum is not an integer, use $.5$ to
denote a half. Otherwise, use $.0$ instead.

Problem 594
===========

For a polygon $P$, let $t(P)$ be the number of ways in which $P$
can be tiled using rhombi and squares with edge length 1. Distinct
rotations and reflections are counted as separate tilings.

For example, if $O$ is a regular octagon with edge length 1, then
$t(O) = 8$. As it happens, all these 8 tilings are rotations of one
another:

::: {.center}
![p594\_octagon\_tilings\_1.png](project/images/p594_octagon_tilings_1.png)

Let $O\_{a,b}$ be the equal-angled convex octagon whose edges
alternate in length between $a$ and $b$.
For example, here is $O\_{2,1}$, with one of its tilings:

::: {.center}

$t(O\_{3,2})=456572$.

Find $t(O\_{4,2})$.

Problem 595
===========

A deck of cards numbered from $1$ to $n$ is shuffled randomly such
that each permutation is equally likely.

The cards are to be sorted into ascending order using the following
technique:

1.  Look at the initial sequence of cards. If it is already sorted, then
    there is no need for further action. Otherwise, if any subsequences
    of cards happen to be in the correct place relative to one another
    (ascending with no gaps), then those subsequences are fixed by
    attaching the cards together. For example, with $7$ cards
    initially in the order 4123756, the cards labelled 1, 2 and 3 would
    be attached together, as would 5 and 6.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  The cards are \'shuffled\' by being thrown into the air, but note
    that any correctly sequenced cards remain attached, so their orders
    are maintained. The cards (or bundles of attached cards) are then
    picked up randomly. You should assume that this randomisation is
    unbiased, despite the fact that some cards are single, and others
    are grouped together.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the cards are sorted.

Let $S(n)$ be the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the
cards. Since the order is checked before the first shuffle, $S(1) =
0$. You are given that $S(2) = 1$, and $S(5) = 4213/871$.

Find $S(52)$, and give your answer rounded to $8$ decimal places.

Problem 596
===========

Let $T(r)$ be the number of integer quadruplets $x, y, z, t$ such
that $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 \le r^2$. In other words, $T(r)$
is the number of lattice points in the four-dimensional hyperball of
radius $r$.

You are given that $T(2) = 89$, $T(5) = 3121$, $T(100) =
493490641$ and $T(10^4) = 49348022079085897$.

Find $T(10^8) \bmod 1000000007$.

Problem 597
===========

The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some
curious rules:

-   A division consists of $n$ boats (typically 13), placed in order
    based on past performance.
-   All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the
    river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest
    upstream.
-   The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch
    the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.
-   Each boat continues rowing until *either* it reaches the finish line
    *or* it catches up with (\"bumps\") a boat in front.
-   The finish line is a distance $L$ metres (the course length, in
    reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of
    the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting
    positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than
    lower-placed boats.)
-   When a \"bump\" occurs, the \"bumping\" boat takes no further part
    in the race. The \"bumped\" boat must continue, however, and may
    even be \"bumped\" again by boats that started two or more places
    behind it.
-   After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division,
    based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat $A$
    that started in a lower place than $B$, then $A$ will be placed
    higher than $B$ in the new order if and only if one of the
    following occurred:
    1.  $A$ bumped $B$ directly
    2.  $A$ bumped another boat that went on to bump $B$
    3.  $A$ bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that
        bumped $B$
    4.  etc

**NOTE**: For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats\'
lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw
level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is
made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat
length\'s overlap.)

Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B\_j$ rows at a steady
speed $v\_j = -$log$X\_j$ metres per second, where the $X\_j$ are
chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1,
independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the
riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.

Let $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an **even
permutation** of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the
division and $L$ is the course length.

For example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as
$A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different
possible outcomes of the race are as follows:

  Bumps occurring                                     New order             Permutation   Probability
  --------------------------------------------------- --------------------- ------------- -------------
  none                                                $A$, $B$, $C$   even          $4/15$
  $B$ bumps $C$                                   $A$, $C$, $B$   odd           $8/45$
  $A$ bumps $B$                                   $B$, $A$, $C$   odd           $1/3$
      $B$ bumps $C$, then $A$ bumps $C$       $C$, $A$, $B$   even          $4/27$
      $A$ bumps $B$, then $B$ bumps $C$       $C$, $B$, $A$   odd           $2/27$

Therefore, $p(3,160) = 4/15 + 4/27 = 56/135$.

You are also given that $p(4,400)=0.5107843137$, rounded to 10 digits
after the decimal point.

Find $p(13,1800)$ rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.

Problem 598
===========

Consider the number $48$.
There are five pairs of integers $a$ and $b$ ($a \leq b$) such
that $a \times b=48$: $(1,48)$, $(2,24)$, $(3,16)$, $(4,12)$
and $(6,8)$.
It can be seen that both $6$ and $8$ have $4$ divisors.
So of those five pairs one consists of two integers with the same number
of divisors.

In general:
Let $C(n)$ be the number of pairs of positive integers $a \times
b=n$, ($a \leq b$) such that $a$ and $b$ have the same number of
divisors;
so $C(48)=1$.

You are given $C(10!)=3$: $(1680, 2160)$, $(1800, 2016)$ and
$(1890,1920)$.

Find $C(100!)$.

Problem 599
===========

The well-known **Rubik\'s Cube** puzzle has many fascinating
mathematical properties. The 2×2×2 variant has 8 cubelets with a total
of 24 visible faces, each with a coloured sticker. Successively turning
faces will rearrange the cubelets, although not all arrangements of
cubelets are reachable without dismantling the puzzle.

Suppose that we wish to apply new stickers to a 2×2×2 Rubik\'s cube in a
non-standard colouring. Specifically, we have $n$ different colours
available (with an unlimited supply of stickers of each colour), and we
place one sticker on each of the 24 faces in any arrangement that we
please. We are not required to use all the colours, and if desired the
same colour may appear in more than one face of a single cubelet.

We say that two such colourings $c\_1,c\_2$ are *essentially distinct*
if a cube coloured according to $c\_1$ cannot be made to match a cube
coloured according to $c\_2$ by performing mechanically possible
Rubik\'s Cube moves.

For example, with two colours available, there are 183 essentially
distinct colourings.

How many essentially distinct colourings are there with 10 different
colours available?

Let $H(n)$ be the number of distinct integer sided **equiangular**
convex hexagons with perimeter not exceeding $n$.
Hexagons are distinct if and only if they are not **congruent**.

Problem 601
===========

For every positive number $n$ we define the function
$\mathop{streak}(n)=k$ as the smallest positive integer $k$ such
that $n+k$ is not divisible by $k+1$.
E.g:
$13$ is divisible by $1$
$14$ is divisible by $2$
$15$ is divisible by $3$
$16$ is divisible by $4$
$17$ is NOT divisible by $5$
So $\mathop{streak}(13) = 4$.
Similarly:
$120$ is divisible by $1$
$121$ is NOT divisible by $2$
So $\mathop{streak}(120) = 1$.

Define $P(s, N)$ to be the number of integers $n$, $1 \lt n \lt
N$, for which $\mathop{streak}(n) = s$.
So $P(3, 14) = 1$ and $P(6, 10^6) = 14286$.

Find the sum, as $i$ ranges from $1$ to $31$, of $P(i, 4^i)$.

Problem 602
===========

Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number,
using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and,
starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone
keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process
ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies
all her friends\' Head counts together to obtain her random number.

As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn,
who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the
sequence of Head/Tail outcomes **THHH---TTTT---THHT---H** beginning and
ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn
obtains 1 head. Alice\'s random number is therefore $2\times 2\times
1 = 4$.

Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice\'s random number,
where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself),
and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.

It turns out that, for any fixed $n$, $e(n, p)$ is always a
polynomial in $p$. For example, $e(3, p) = p^3 + 4p^2 + p$.

Define $c(n, k)$ to be the coefficient of $p^k$ in the polynomial
$e(n, p)$. So $c(3, 1) = 1$, $c(3, 2) = 4$, and $c(3, 3) = 1$.

You are given that $c(100, 40) \equiv 986699437 \text{ } (\text{mod
} 10^9+7)$.

Find $c(10000000, 4000000) \mod 10^9+7$.

Problem 603
===========

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all contiguous integer-substrings that can be
formed from the integer $n$. The substrings need not be distinct.

For example, $S(2024) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 20 + 02 + 24 + 202 + 024 + 2024
= 2304$.

Let $P(n)$ be the integer formed by concatenating the first $n$
primes together. For example, $P(7) = 2357111317$.

Let $C(n, k)$ be the integer formed by concatenating $k$ copies of
$P(n)$ together. For example, $C(7, 3) =
235711131723571113172357111317$.

Evaluate $S(C(10^6, 10^{12})) \bmod (10^9 + 7)$.

Problem 605
===========

Consider an $n$-player game played in consecutive pairs: Round $1$
takes place between players $1$ and $2$, round $2$ takes place
between players $2$ and $3$, and so on and so forth, all the way up
to round $n$, which takes place between players $n$ and $1$. Then
round $n+1$ takes place between players $1$ and $2$ as the entire
cycle starts again.

In other words, during round $r$, player $((r-1) \bmod n) + 1$
faces off against player $(r \bmod n) + 1$.

During each round, a fair coin is tossed to decide which of the two
players wins that round. If any given player wins both rounds $r$ and
$r+1$, then that player wins the entire game.

Let $P\_n(k)$ be the probability that player $k$ wins in an
$n$-player game, in the form of a reduced fraction. For example,
$P\_3(1) = 12/49$ and $P\_6(2) = 368/1323$.

Let $M\_n(k)$ be the product of the reduced numerator and denominator
of $P\_n(k)$. For example, $M\_3(1) = 588$ and $M\_6(2) = 486864$.

Find the last $8$ digits of $M\_{10^8+7}(10^4+7)$.

Problem 606
===========

A **gozinta chain** for $n$ is a sequence $\{1,a,b,\dots,n\}$
where each element properly divides the next.
For example, there are eight distinct gozinta chains for $12$:
$\{1,12\}$, $\{1,2,12\}$, $\{1,2,4,12\}$,
$\{1,2,6,12\}$, $\{1,3,12\}$, $\{1,3,6,12\}$,
$\{1,4,12\}$ and $\{1,6,12\}$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all numbers, $k$, not exceeding $n$,
which have $252$ distinct gozinta chains.
You are given $S(10^6)=8462952$ and $S(10^{12})=623291998881978$.

Find $S(10^{36})$, giving the last nine digits of your answer.

Problem 607
===========

Frodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point
B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the
journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long
marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through
the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all
points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A
map of the region is shown in the diagram below:

::: {.center}
![p607\_marsh.png](project/images/p607_marsh.png)
:::

The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as
shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is
relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per
day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the
speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final
region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again,
with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.

If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would
travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately
13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from
the direct path.

Find the shortest possible time required to travel from point A to B,
and give your answer in days, rounded to 10 decimal places.

Problem 608
===========

Let $D(m,n)=\displaystyle\sum\_{d\mid
m}\sum\_{k=1}^n\sigma\_0(kd)$ where $d$ runs through all divisors
of $m$ and $\sigma\_0(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$.
You are given $D(3!,10^2)=3398$ and $D(4!,10^6)=268882292$.

Find $D(200!,10^{12}) \bmod (10^9 + 7)$.

Problem 609
===========

For every $n \ge 1$ the **prime-counting** function $\pi(n)$ is
equal to the number of primes not exceeding $n$.
E.g. $\pi(6)=3$ and $\pi(100)=25$.

We say that a sequence of integers $u = (u\_0,\cdots,u\_m)$ is a
[$\pi$ sequence]{.dfn} if

-   $u\_n \ge 1$ for every $n$
-   $u\_{n+1}= \pi(u\_n)$
-   $u$ has two or more elements

For $u\_0=10$ there are three distinct $\pi$ sequences: $(10,4)$,
$(10,4,2)$ and $(10,4,2,1)$.

Let $c(u)$ be the number of elements of $u$ that are not prime.
Let $p(n,k)$ be the number of $\pi$ sequences $u$ for which
$u\_0\le n$ and $c(u)=k$.
Let $P(n)$ be the product of all $p(n,k)$ that are larger than
$0$.
You are given: $P(10)=3 \times 8 \times 9 \times 3=648$ and
$P(100)=31038676032$.

Find $P(10^8)$. Give your answer modulo $1000000007$.

Problem 610
===========

A random generator produces a sequence of symbols drawn from the set
{[I]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[V]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[X]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[L]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[C]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[D]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[M]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"},
[\#]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"}}. Each item in the
sequence is determined by selecting one of these symbols at random,
independently of the other items in the sequence. At each step, the
seven letters are equally likely to be selected, with probability 14%
each, but the [\#]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"} symbol
only has a 2% chance of selection.

We write down the sequence of letters from left to right as they are
generated, and we stop at the first occurrence of the
[\#]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"} symbol (without
writing it). However, we stipulate that what we have written down must
always (when non-empty) be a valid Roman numeral representation in
minimal form. If appending the next letter would contravene this then we
simply skip it and try again with the next symbol generated.

Please take careful note of [About\... Roman
Numerals](about=roman_numerals) for the definitive rules for this
problem on what constitutes a \"valid Roman numeral representation\" and
\"minimal form\". For example, the (only) sequence that represents 49 is
[XLIX]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"}. The subtractive
combination [IL]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"} is
invalid because of rule (ii), while
[XXXXIX]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"} is valid but not
minimal. The rules do not place any restriction on the number of
occurrences of [M]{style="font-family:'courier new', monospace;"}, so
all positive integers have a valid representation. These are the same
rules as were used in [Problem 89](problem=89), and members are invited
to solve that problem first.

Find the expected value of the number represented by what we have
written down when we stop. (If nothing is written down then count that
as zero.) Give your answer rounded to 8 places after the decimal point.

Problem 611
===========

Peter moves in a hallway with $N + 1$ doors consecutively numbered
from $0$ through $N$. All doors are initially closed. Peter starts
in front of door $0$, and repeatedly performs the following steps:

-   First, he walks a positive square number of doors away from his
    position.
-   Then he walks another, larger square number of doors away from his
    new position.
-   He toggles the door he faces (opens it if closed, closes it if
    open).
-   And finally returns to door $0$.

We call an action any sequence of those steps. Peter never performs the
exact same action twice, and makes sure to perform all possible actions
that don\'t bring him past the last door.

Let $F(N)$ be the number of doors that are open after Peter has
performed all possible actions. You are given that $F(5) = 1$,
$F(100) = 27$, $F(1000) = 233$ and $F(10^6) = 112168$.

Find $F(10^{12})$.

Problem 612

Let\'s call two numbers [friend numbers]{.dfn} if their representation
in base $10$ has at least one common digit.
E.g. $1123$ and $3981$ are friend numbers.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs $(p,q)$ with $1\le p \lt q \lt
n$ such that $p$ and $q$ are friend numbers.
$f(100)=1539$.

Find $f(10^{18}) \bmod 1000267129$.

Dave is doing his homework on the balcony and, preparing a presentation
about Pythagorean triangles, has just cut out a triangle with side
lengths 30cm, 40cm and 50cm from some cardboard, when a gust of wind
blows the triangle down into the garden.
Another gust blows a small ant straight onto this triangle. The poor ant
is completely disoriented and starts to crawl straight ahead in random
direction in order to get back into the grass.

Assuming that all possible positions of the ant within the triangle and
all possible directions of moving on are equiprobable, what is the
probability that the ant leaves the triangle along its longest side?
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.

Problem 614
===========

An **integer partition** of a number $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as
a sum of positive integers. Partitions that differ only by the order of
their summands are considered the same.

We call an integer partition [special]{.dfn} if 1) all its summands are
distinct, and 2) all its even summands are also divisible by $4$.
For example, the special partitions of $10$ are: \\[10 =
1+4+5=3+7=1+9\\] The number $10$ admits many more integer partitions
(a total of $42$), but only those three are special.

Let be $P(n)$ the number of special integer partitions of $n$. You
are given that $P(1) = 1$, $P(2) = 0$, $P(3) = 1$, $P(6) = 1$,
$P(10)=3$, $P(100) = 37076$ and $P(1000)=3699177285485660336$.

Problem 615
===========

Consider the natural numbers having at least $5$ prime factors, which
don\'t have to be distinct.
Sorting these numbers by size gives a list which starts with:

-   $32=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$
-   $48=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
-   $64=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$
-   $72=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3$
-   $80=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$
-   $96=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
-   $\cdots$

So, for example, the fifth number with at least $5$ prime factors is
$80$.

Find the millionth number with at least one million prime factors.
Give your answer modulo $123454321$.

Problem 616
===========

Alice plays the following game, she starts with a list of integers $L$
and on each step she can either:

-   remove two elements $a$ and $b$ from $L$ and add $a^b$ to
    $L$
-   or conversely remove an element $c$ from $L$ that can be written
    as $a^b$, with $a$ and $b$ being two integers such that $a,
    b \> 1$, and add both $a$ and $b$ to $L$

For example starting from the list $L=\{8\}$, Alice can remove $8$
and add $2$ and $3$ resulting in $L=\{2,3\}$ in a first step.
Then she can obtain $L=\{9\}$ in a second step.

Note that the same integer is allowed to appear multiple times in the
list.

An integer $n\>1$ is said to be [creative]{.dfn} if for any integer
$m \gt 1$ Alice can obtain a list that contains $m$ starting from
$L=\{n\}$.

Find the sum of all creative integers less than or equal to
$10^{12}$.

Problem 617
===========

For two integers $n,e \gt 1$, we define an [$(n,e)$-MPS (Mirror
Power Sequence)]{.dfn} to be an infinite sequence of integers
$(a\_i)\_{i\ge 0}$ such that for all $i\ge 0$, $a\_{i+1} =
\min(a\_i^e,n-a\_i^e)$ and $a\_i \gt 1$.
Examples of such sequences are the two $(18,2)$-MPS sequences made of
alternating $2$ and $4$.

Note that even though such a sequence is uniquely determined by $n,e$
and $a\_0$, for most values such a sequence does not exist. For
example, no $(n,e)$-MPS exists for $n \lt 6$.

Define $C(n)$ to be the number of $(n,e)$-MPS for some $e$, and
$\displaystyle D(N) = \sum\_{n=2}^N C(n)$.
You are given that $D(10) = 2$, $D(100) = 21$, $D(1000) = 69$,
$D(10^6) = 1303$ and $D(10^{12}) = 1014800$.

Problem 618
===========

Consider the numbers $15$, $16$ and $18$:
$15=3\times 5$ and $3+5=8$.
$16 = 2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ and $2+2+2+2=8$.
$18 = 2\times 3\times 3$ and $2+3+3=8$.
$15$, $16$ and $18$ are the only numbers that have $8$ as sum of
the prime factors (counted with multiplicity).

We define $S(k)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n$ where the sum of
the prime factors (with multiplicity) of $n$ is $k$.
Hence $S(8) = 15+16+18 = 49$.
Other examples: $S(1) = 0$, $S(2) = 2$, $S(3) = 3$, $S(5) = 5 + 6
= 11$.

The Fibonacci sequence is $F\_1 = 1$, $F\_2 = 1$, $F\_3 = 2$,

$\displaystyle\sum\_{k=2}^{24}S(F\_k)$.

Problem 619
===========

For a set of positive integers $\{a, a+1, a+2, \dots , b\}$, let
$C(a,b)$ be the number of non-empty subsets in which the product of
all elements is a perfect square.

For example $C(5,10)=3$, since the products of all elements of $\{5,
8, 10\}$, $\{5, 8, 9, 10\}$ and $\{9\}$ are perfect squares,
and no other subsets of $\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ have this property.

You are given that $C(40,55) =15$, and $C(1000,1234) \bmod
1000000007=975523611$.

Find $C(1000000,1234567) \bmod 1000000007$.

Problem 620
===========

A circle $C$ of circumference $c$ centimetres has a smaller circle
$S$ of circumference $s$ centimetres lying off-centre within it.
Four other distinct circles, which we call \"planets\", with
circumferences $p$, $p$, $q$, $q$ centimetres respectively
($p\<q$), are inscribed within $C$ but outside $S$, with each
planet touching both $C$ and $S$ tangentially. The planets are
permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of $S$ and $C$
must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.

Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing
teeth at a pitch of 1cm. $C$ is an internal gear with teeth on the
inside. We require that $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$ are all integers (as
they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear
must have at least 5 teeth.

Note that \"perfectly meshing\" means that as the gears rotate, the
ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth
of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice
versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for
$S$ and $C$ each to mesh perfectly with all the planets.
Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.

Define $g(c,s,p,q)$ to be the number of such gear arrangements for
given values of $c$, $s$, $p$, $q$: it turns out that this is
finite as only certain discrete arrangements are possible satisfying the
above conditions. For example, $g(16,5,5,6)=9$.

Here is one such arrangement:

::: {align="center"}
![Example arrangement](project/images/p620_planetary_gears.png)

Let $G(n) = \sum\_{s+p+q\le n} g(s+p+q,s,p,q)$ where the sum only
includes cases with $p\<q$, $p\ge 5$, and $s\ge 5$, all
integers. You are given that $G(16)=9$ and $G(20)=205$.

Find $G(500)$.

Problem 621
===========

Gauss famously proved that every positive integer can be expressed as
the sum of three **triangular numbers** (including $0$ as the lowest
triangular number). In fact most numbers can be expressed as a sum of
three triangular numbers in several ways.

Let $G(n)$ be the number of ways of expressing $n$ as the sum of
three triangular numbers, regarding different arrangements of the terms
of the sum as distinct.

For example, $G(9) = 7$, as $9$ can be expressed as: $3+3+3$,
$0+3+6$, $0+6+3$, $3+0+6$, $3+6+0$, $6+0+3$, $6+3+0$.
You are given $G(1000) = 78$ and $G(10^6) = 2106$.

Find $G(17526 \times 10^9)$.

Problem 622
===========

A riffle shuffle is executed as follows: a deck of cards is split into
two equal halves, with the top half taken in the left hand and the
bottom half taken in the right hand. Next, the cards are interleaved
exactly, with the top card in the right half inserted just after the top
card in the left half, the 2nd card in the right half just after the 2nd
card in the left half, etc. (Note that this process preserves the
location of the top and bottom card of the deck)

Let $s(n)$ be the minimum number of consecutive riffle shuffles needed
to restore a deck of size $n$ to its original configuration, where
$n$ is a positive even number.

Amazingly, a standard deck of $52$ cards will first return to its
original configuration after only $8$ perfect shuffles, so $s(52) =
8$. It can be verified that a deck of $86$ cards will also return to
its original configuration after exactly $8$ shuffles, and the sum of
all values of $n$ that satisfy $s(n) = 8$ is $412$.

Find the sum of all values of n that satisfy $s(n) = 60$.

Problem 623
===========

The **lambda-calculus** is a universal model of computation at the core
of functional programming languages. It is based on **lambda-terms**, a
minimal programming language featuring only function definitions,
function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the
following rules:

-   Any **variable** $x$ (single letter, from some infinite alphabet)
    is a lambda-term.
-   If $M$ and $N$ are lambda-terms, then $(M N)$ is a
    lambda-term, called the **application** of $M$ to $N$.
-   If $x$ is a variable and $M$ is a term, then $(\lambda x. M)$
    is a lambda-term, called an **abstraction**. An abstraction defines
    an anonymous function, taking $x$ as parameter and sending back
    $M$.

A lambda-term $T$ is said to be **closed** if for all variables $x$,
all occurrences of $x$ within $T$ are contained within some
abstraction $(\lambda x. M)$ in $T$. The smallest such abstraction
is said to **bind** the occurrence of the variable $x$. In other
words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to
parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term
$(\lambda x. x)$ is closed, while the term $(\lambda x. (x y))$ is
not because $y$ is not bound.

Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes.
This means that $(\lambda x. x)$ and $(\lambda y. y)$ should be
considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms
equivalent modulo such renaming are called *$\alpha$-equivalent*.
Note that $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and $(\lambda x.
(\lambda x. (x x)))$ are not $\alpha$-equivalent, since the
abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the
inner one. However, $(\lambda x. (\lambda y. (x y)))$ and
$(\lambda y. (\lambda x. (y x)))$ are $\alpha$-equivalent.

The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with
at most $15$ symbols, symbols being parenthesis, $\lambda$, dot and
variables.

\\[\begin{array}{\|c\|c\|c\|c\|} \hline (\lambda x.x) & (\lambda
x.(x x)) & (\lambda x.(\lambda y.x)) & (\lambda x.(\lambda y.y))
\\ \hline (\lambda x.(x (x x))) & (\lambda x.((x x) x)) & (\lambda
x.(\lambda y.(x x))) & (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(x y))) \\ \hline
(\lambda x.(\lambda y.(y x))) & (\lambda x.(\lambda y.(y y))) &
(\lambda x.(x (\lambda y.x))) & (\lambda x.(x (\lambda y.y))) \

Let be $\Lambda(n)$ the number of distinct closed lambda-terms that

$\alpha$-equivalent to one another should be counted only once. You

Problem 624
===========

An unbiased coin is tossed repeatedly until two consecutive heads are
obtained. Suppose these occur on the $(M-1)$th and $M$th toss.
Let $P(n)$ be the probability that $M$ is divisible by $n$. For
example, the outcomes HH, HTHH, and THTTHH all count towards $P(2)$,
but THH and HTTHH do not.

You are given that $P(2) =\frac 3 5$ and $P(3)=\frac 9 {31}$.
Indeed, it can be shown that $P(n)$ is always a rational number.

For a prime $p$ and a fully reduced fraction $\frac a b$, define
$Q(\frac a b,p)$ to be the smallest positive $q$ for which $a
\equiv b q \pmod{p}$.
For example $Q(P(2), 109) = Q(\frac 3 5, 109) = 66$, because $5
\cdot 66 = 330 \equiv 3 \pmod{109}$ and $66$ is the smallest
positive such number.
Similarly $Q(P(3),109) = 46$.

Find $Q(P(10^{18}),1\,000\,000\,009)$.

Problem 626
===========

A binary matrix is a matrix consisting entirely of $0$s and $1$s.
Consider the following transformations that can be performed on a binary
matrix:

-   Swap any two rows
-   Swap any two columns
-   Flip all elements in a single row ($1$s become $0$s, $0$s
    become $1$s)
-   Flip all elements in a single column

Two binary matrices $A$ and $B$ will be considered
[equivalent]{.dfn} if there is a sequence of such transformations that
when applied to $A$ yields $B$. For example, the following two
matrices are equivalent:

$A=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \
\end{pmatrix} \quad B=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0
& 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$

via the sequence of two transformations \"Flip all elements in column
3\" followed by \"Swap rows 1 and 2\".

Define $c(n)$ to be the maximum number of $n\times n$ binary
matrices that can be found such that no two are equivalent. For example,
$c(3)=3$. You are also given that $c(5)=39$ and $c(8)=656108$.

Find $c(20)$, and give your answer modulo $1\,001\,001\,011$.

Consider the set $S$ of all possible products of $n$ positive
integers not exceeding $m$, that is
$S=\{ x\_1x\_2\cdots x\_n \mid 1 \le x\_1, x\_2, \dots, x\_n \le
m \}$.
Let $F(m,n)$ be the number of the distinct elements of the set $S$.
For example, $F(9, 2) = 36$ and $F(30,2)=308$.

Find $F(30, 10001) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 628
===========

A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces
placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all
positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a $n \times n$ board in
such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.

We call such a position an [open]{.dfn} position, if a rook, starting at
the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or
upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field
occupied by a pawn.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \times n$
chessboard.
For example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3
\times 3$ chessboard below.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------- -- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Problem 629
===========

Alice and Bob are playing a modified game of Nim called Scatterstone
Nim, with Alice going first, alternating turns with Bob. The game begins
with an arbitrary set of stone piles with a total number of stones equal
to $n$.

During a player\'s turn, he/she must pick a pile having at least $2$
stones and perform a split operation, dividing the pile into an
arbitrary set of $p$ non-empty, arbitrarily-sized piles where $2
\leq p \leq k$ for some fixed constant $k$. For example, a pile of
size $4$ can be split into $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 2\}$, or
$\{1, 1, 2\}$ if $k = 3$ and in addition $\{1, 1, 1, 1\}$ if
$k = 4$.

If no valid move is possible on a given turn, then the other player wins
the game.

A winning position is defined as a set of stone piles where a player can
ultimately ensure victory no matter what the other player does.

Let $f(n,k)$ be the number of winning positions for Alice on her first
turn, given parameters $n$ and $k$. For example, $f(5, 2) = 3$
with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}$. In
contrast, $f(5, 3) = 5$ with winning positions $\{1, 1, 1, 2\},
\{1, 1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{5\}$.

Let $g(n)$ be the sum of $f(n,k)$ over all $2 \leq k \leq n$.
For example, $g(7)=66$ and $g(10)=291$.

Find $g(200) \bmod (10^9 + 7)$.

Problem 630
===========

Given a set, $L$, of unique lines, let $M(L)$ be the number of lines
in the set and let $S(L)$ be the sum over every line of the number of
times that line is crossed by another line in the set. For example, two
sets of three lines are shown below:

::: {align="center"}
![crossed lines](resources/images/0630_threelines.png?1678992054)
:::

In both cases $M(L)$ is $3$ and $S(L)$ is $6$: each of the three
lines is crossed by two other lines. Note that even if the lines cross
at a single point, all of the separate crossings of lines are counted.

Consider points $(T\_{2k-1}, T\_{2k})$, for integer $k \ge 1$,
generated in the following way:

$S\_0 = 290797$
$S\_{n+1} = S\_n^2 \bmod 50515093$
$T\_n = (S\_n \bmod 2000) - 1000$

For example, the first three points are: $(527, 144)$, $(-488,
732)$, $(-454, -947)$. Given the first $n$ points generated in this
manner, let $L\_n$ be the set of **unique** lines that can be formed
by joining each point with every other point, the lines being extended
indefinitely in both directions. We can then define $M(L\_n)$ and
$S(L\_n)$ as described above.

For example, $M(L\_3) = 3$ and $S(L\_3) = 6$. Also $M(L\_{100}) =
4948$ and $S(L\_{100}) = 24477690$.

Find $S(L\_{2500})$.

Problem 631
===========

Let $(p\_1 p\_2 \ldots p\_k)$ denote the permutation of the set ${1,
\..., k}$ that maps $p\_i\mapsto i$. Define the length of the
permutation to be $k$; note that the empty permutation $()$ has
length zero.

Define an [occurrence]{.dfn} of a permutation $p=(p\_1 p\_2 \cdots
p\_k)$ in a permutation $P=(P\_1 P\_2 \cdots P\_n)$ to be a sequence
$1\leq t\_1 \lt t\_2 \lt \cdots \lt t\_k \leq n$ such that
$p\_i \lt p\_j$ if and only if $P\_{t\_i} \lt P\_{t\_j}$ for all
$i,j \in \{1, \dots, k\}$.

For example, $(1243)$ occurs twice in the permutation $(314625)$:
once as the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th elements $(3\,\,46\,\,5)$, and
once as the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th elements $(\,\,146\,\,5)$.

Let $f(n, m)$ be the number of permutations $P$ of length at most
$n$ such that there is no occurrence of the permutation $1243$ in
$P$ and there are at most $m$ occurrences of the permutation $21$
in $P$.

For example, $f(2,0) = 3$, with the permutations $()$, $(1)$,
$(1,2)$ but not $(2,1)$.

You are also given that $f(4, 5) = 32$ and $f(10, 25) = 294\,400$.

Find $f(10^{18}, 40)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 632

and $5$.

Let $C\_k(N)$ be the number of integers between $1$ and $N$
inclusive with exactly $k$ square prime factors. You are given some

and $5$.

Let $C\_k(N)$ be the number of integers between $1$ and $N$
inclusive with exactly $k$ square prime factors. It can be shown that
with growing $N$ the ratio $\frac{C\_k(N)}{N}$ gets arbitrarily
close to a constant $c\_{k}^{\infty}$, as suggested by the table
below.

the result in scientific notation rounded to $5$ significant digits,

Define $F(n)$ to be the number of integers $x≤n$ that can be written
in the form $x=a^2b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers not
necessarily different and both greater than 1.

For example, $32=2^2\times 2^3$ and $72=3^2\times 2^3$ are the
only two integers less than $100$ that can be written in this form.
Hence, $F(100)=2$.

Further you are given $F(2\times 10^4)=130$ and $F(3\times

1) $B$ has exactly $n$ elements;
2) the sum of the elements of $B$ is divisible by $n$.

E.g. $A\_2(5)=52$ and $A\_3(5)=603$.

Let $S\_q(L)$ be $\sum A\_q(p)$ where the sum is taken over all
primes $p \le L$.
E.g. $S\_2(10)=554$, $S\_2(100)$ mod

Problem 636
===========

Consider writing a natural number as product of powers of natural
numbers with given exponents, additionally requiring different base
numbers for each power.

For example, $256$ can be written as a product of a square and a
fourth power in three ways such that the base numbers are different.
That is, $256=1^2\times 4^4=4^2\times 2^4=16^2\times 1^4$

Though $4^2$ and $2^4$ are both equal, we are concerned only about
the base numbers in this problem. Note that permutations are not
considered distinct, for example $16^2\times 1^4$ and $1^4
\times 16^2$ are considered to be the same.

Similarly, $10!$ can be written as a product of one natural number,
two squares and three cubes in two ways
($10!=42\times5^2\times4^2\times3^3\times2^3\times1^3=21\times5^2\times2^2\times4^3\times3^3\times1^3$)
whereas $20!$ can be given the same representation in $41680$ ways.

Let $F(n)$ denote the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as
a product of one natural number, two squares, three cubes and four
fourth powers.

You are given that $F(25!)=4933$, $F(100!) \bmod
1\,000\,000\,007=693\,952\,493$,
and $F(1\,000!) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007=6\,364\,496$.

Find $F(1\,000\,000!) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 637
===========

Given any positive integer $n$, we can construct a new integer by
inserting plus signs between some of the digits of the base $B$
representation of $n$, and then carrying out the additions.

For example, from $n=123\_{10}$ ($n$ in base $10$) we can
construct the four base $10$ integers $123\_{10}$,
$1+23=24\_{10}$, $12+3=15\_{10}$ and $1+2+3=6\_{10}$.

Let $f(n,B)$ be the smallest number of steps needed to arrive at a
single-digit number in base $B$. For example, $f(7,10)=0$ and
$f(123,10)=1$.

Let $g(n,B\_1,B\_2)$ be the sum of the positive integers $i$ not
exceeding $n$ such that $f(i,B\_1)=f(i,B\_2)$.

Problem 640
===========

Bob plays a single-player game of chance using two standard 6-sided dice
and twelve cards numbered 1 to 12. When the game starts, all cards are
placed face up on a table.

Each turn, Bob rolls both dice, getting numbers $x$ and $y$
respectively, each in the range 1,\...,6. He must choose amongst three
options: turn over card $x$, card $y$, or card $x+y$. (If the
chosen card is already face down, it is turned to face up, and vice
versa.)

If Bob manages to have all twelve cards face down at the same time, he
wins.

Alice plays a similar game, except that instead of dice she uses two
fair coins, counting heads as 2 and tails as 1, and that she uses four
cards instead of twelve. Alice finds that, with the optimal strategy for
her game, the expected number of turns taken until she wins is
approximately 5.673651.

Assuming that Bob plays with an optimal strategy, what is the expected
number of turns taken until he wins? Give your answer rounded to 6

Problem 641
===========

Consider a row of $n$ dice all showing 1.

First turn every second die,$ (2,4,6,\ldots)$, so that the number
showing is increased by 1. Then turn every third die. The sixth die will
now show a 3. Then turn every fourth die and so on until every $n$th
die (only the last die) is turned. If the die to be turned is showing a
6 then it is changed to show a 1.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of dice that are showing a 1 when the process
finishes. You are given $f(100)=2$ and $f(10^8) = 69$.

Problem 643
===========

Two positive integers $a$ and $b$ are [$2$-friendly]{.dfn} when
$\gcd(a,b) = 2^t, t \gt 0$. For example, $24$ and $40$ are
$2$-friendly because $\gcd(24,40) = 8 = 2^3$ while $24$ and
$36$ are not because $\gcd(24,36) = 12 = 2^2\cdot 3$ not a power
of $2$.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs, $(p,q)$, of positive integers
with $1\le p\lt q\le n$ such that $p$ and $q$ are
$2$-friendly. You are given $f(10^2) = 1031$ and $f(10^6) =

Problem 644
===========

Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line
segment of length $L$ by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the
line segment.

As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different
ways, either \"straight\" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides
on the line segment, or \"diagonal\" by placing two opposite corners on
the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are
not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line
segment wins.

::: {.center}
![0644\_squareline.png](resources/images/0644_squareline.png?1678992054)
:::

With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly
realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square
in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring.

Therefore they decide to randomise Sam\'s first move, by first tossing a
fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or
diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on
the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally
likely. Sam\'s gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game
and $L$ if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam\'s
initial move, you can see that Sam\'s expected gain, called $e(L)$, is
only dependent on the length of the line segment.

For example, if $L=2$, Sam will win with a probability of $1$, so
$e(2)= 2$.
Choosing $L=4$, the winning probability will be $0.33333333$ for the
straight case and $0.22654092$ for the diagonal case, leading to
$e(4)=1.11974851$ (rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point
each).

Being interested in the optimal value of $L$ for Sam, let\'s define
$f(a,b)$ to be the maximum of $e(L)$ for some $L \in \[a,b\]$.
You are given $f(2,10)=2.61969775$, being reached for $L=
7.82842712$, and $f(10,20)= 5.99374121$ (rounded to $8$ digits
each).

On planet J, a year lasts for $D$ days. Holidays are defined by the

1.  At the beginning of the reign of the current Emperor, his birthday
    is declared a holiday from that year onwards.
2.  If both the day before and after a day $d$ are holidays, then

Initially there are no holidays. Let $E(D)$ be the expected number of

Let $n$ be a natural number and $p\_1^{\alpha\_1}\cdot
p\_2^{\alpha\_2}\cdots p\_k^{\alpha\_k}$ its prime factorisation.
Define the **Liouville function** $\lambda(n)$ as $\lambda(n) =

Problem 647
===========

It is possible to find positive integers $A$ and $B$ such that given
any triangular number, $T\_n$, then $AT\_n +B$ is always a
triangular number. We define $F\_3(N)$ to be the sum of $(A+B)$ over
all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le N$. For example
$F\_3(100) = 184$.

Polygonal numbers are generalisations of triangular numbers. Polygonal
numbers with parameter $k$ we call $k$-gonal numbers. The formula
for the $n$th $k$-gonal number is $\frac
12n\big(n(k-2)+4-k\big)$ where $n \ge 1$. For example when $k =
3$ we get $\frac 12n(n+1)$ the formula for triangular numbers.

The statement above is true for pentagonal, heptagonal and in fact any
$k$-gonal number with $k$ odd. For example when $k=5$ we get the
pentagonal numbers and we can find positive integers $A$ and $B$
such that given any pentagonal number, $P\_n$, then $AP\_n+B$ is
always a pentagonal number. We define $F\_5(N)$ to be the sum of
$(A+B)$ over all such possible pairs $(A,B)$ with $\max(A,B)\le
N$.

Similarly we define $F\_k(N)$ for odd $k$. You are given
$\sum\_{k} F\_k(10^3) = 14993$ where the sum is over all odd $k =
3,5,7,\ldots$.

Find $\sum\_{k} F\_k(10^{12})$ where the sum is over all odd $k =
3,5,7,\ldots$

Problem 648
===========

For some fixed $\rho \in \[0, 1\]$, we begin a sum $s$ at $0$
and repeatedly apply a process: With probability $\rho$, we add $1$
to $s$, otherwise we add $2$ to $s$.

The process ends when either $s$ is a perfect square or $s$ exceeds
$10^{18}$, whichever occurs first. For example, if $s$ goes through
$0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9$, the process ends at $s=9$, and two squares $1$
and $4$ were skipped over.

Let $f(\rho)$ be the expected number of perfect squares skipped over
when the process finishes.

It can be shown that the power series for $f(\rho)$ is
$\sum\_{k=0}^\infty a\_k \rho^k$ for a suitable (unique) choice
of coefficients $a\_k$. Some of the first few coefficients are
$a\_0=1$, $a\_1=0$, $a\_5=-18$, $a\_{10}=45176$.

Let $F(n) = \sum\_{k=0}^n a\_k$. You are given that $F(10) =

Problem 649
===========

Alice and Bob are taking turns playing a game consisting of $c$
different coins on a chessboard of size $n$ by $n$.

The game may start with any arrangement of $c$ coins in squares on the
board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the
same square on the board at the same time. The coins are
distinguishable, so swapping two coins gives a different arrangement if
(and only if) they are on different squares.

On a given turn, the player must choose a coin and move it either left
or up $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$ spaces in a single direction. The
only restriction is that the coin cannot move off the edge of the board.

The game ends when a player is unable to make a valid move, thereby
granting the other player the victory.

Assuming that Alice goes first and that both players are playing
optimally, let $M(n, c)$ be the number of possible starting
arrangements for which Alice can ensure her victory, given a board of
size $n$ by $n$ with $c$ distinct coins.

For example, $M(3, 1) = 4$, $M(3, 2) = 40$, and $M(9, 3) =
450304$.

What are the last $9$ digits of $M(10\,000\,019, 100)$?

Problem 650

Let $B(n) = \displaystyle \prod\_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}$, a product

\choose 2} \times {5 \choose 3} \times {5 \choose 4} \times {5
\choose 5} = 1 \times 5 \times 10 \times 10 \times 5 \times 1 =
2500$.

Let $D(n) = \displaystyle \sum\_{d\|B(n)} d$, the sum of the
divisors of $B(n)$.
For example, the divisors of B(5) are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100,
125, 250, 500, 625, 1250 and 2500,
so D(5) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 +
625 + 1250 + 2500 = 5467.

Let $S(n) = \displaystyle \sum\_{k=1}^n D(k)$.
You are given $S(5) = 5736$, $S(10) = 141740594713218418$ and

Problem 651
===========

An infinitely long cylinder has its curved surface fully covered with
different coloured but otherwise identical rectangular stickers, without
overlapping. The stickers are aligned with the cylinder, so two of their
edges are parallel with the cylinder\'s axis, with four stickers meeting
at each corner.

Let $a\>0$ and suppose that the colouring is periodic along the
cylinder, with the pattern repeating every $a$ stickers. (The period
is allowed to be any divisor of $a$.) Let $b$ be the number of
stickers that fit round the circumference of the cylinder.

Let $f(m, a, b)$ be the number of different such periodic patterns
that use *exactly* $m$ distinct colours of stickers. Translations
along the axis, reflections in any plane, rotations in any axis, (or
combinations of such operations) applied to a pattern are to be counted
as the same as the original pattern.

You are given that $f(2, 2, 3) = 11$, $f(3, 2, 3) = 56$, and $f(2,
3, 4) = 156$. Furthermore, $f(8, 13, 21) \equiv 49718354
\pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$, and $f(13, 144, 233) \equiv 907081451

Find $\sum\_{i=4}^{40} f(i, F\_{i-1}, F\_i) \bmod

Problem 652
===========

Consider the values of $\log\_2(8)$, $\log\_4(64)$ and
$\log\_3(27)$. All three are equal to $3$.

Generally, the function $f(m,n)=\log\_m(n)$ over integers $m,n \ge
2$ has the property that
$f(m\_1,n\_1)=f(m\_2,n\_2)$ if

1.  $\, m\_1=a^e, n\_1=a^f, m\_2=b^e,n\_2=b^f \,$ for some
    integers $a,b,e,f \, \,$ or
2.  $ \, m\_1=a^e, n\_1=b^e, m\_2=a^f,n\_2=b^f \,$ for some
    integers $a,b,e,f \,$

We call a function $g(m,n)$ over integers $m,n \ge 2$
[proto-logarithmic]{.dfn} if

-   $\quad \, \, \, \, g(m\_1,n\_1)=g(m\_2,n\_2)$ if any integers
    $a,b,e,f$ fulfilling 1. or 2. can be found
-   **and** $\, g(m\_1,n\_1) \ne g(m\_2,n\_2)$ if no integers
    $a,b,e,f$ fulfilling 1. or 2. can be found.

Let $D(N)$ be the number of distinct values that any proto-logarithmic
function $g(m,n)$ attains over $2\le m, n\le N$.
For example, $D(5)=13$, $D(10)=69$, $D(100)=9607$ and
$D(10000)=99959605$.

Find $D(10^{18})$, and give the last $9$ digits as answer.


**Note:** According to the **four exponentials conjecture** the function
$\log\_m(n)$ is [proto-logarithmic]{.dfn}.
While this conjecture is yet unproven in general, $\log\_m(n)$ can be
used to calculate $D(N)$ for small values of $N$.

Problem 653
===========

Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length $L$ millimetres,
and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open,
while the west end is sealed. The tube contains $N$ marbles of
diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one
initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed $v$.

Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound
to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly
elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and
continue with speed $v$ away from the collision site. Similarly, if
the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it
instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed $v$. On
the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits
the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.

To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the
pseudo-random sequence $r\_j$ defined by:
$r\_1 = 6\,563\,116$
$r\_{j+1} = r\_j^2 \bmod 32\,745\,673$
The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of $(r\_1
\bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres between it and the sealed end of the
tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble.
Then, for $2\le j\le N$, counting from the west, the gap between the
$(j-1)$th and $j$th marbles, as measured from their closest points,
is given by $(r\_j \bmod 1000) + 1$ millimetres. Furthermore, the
$j$th marble is initially moving eastward if $r\_j \le
10\,000\,000$, and westward if $r\_j \> 10\,000\,000$.

For example, with $N=3$, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and
173 millimetres. The marbles\' *centres* are therefore 127, 579, and 772
millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble
initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.

Under this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out
that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its
centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.

Let $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th
marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So
$d(5000, 3, 2) = 5519$. You are also given that $d(10\,000, 11, 6) =
11\,780$ and $d(100\,000, 101, 51) = 114\,101$.

$(1, 2, 1, 1)$
$(1, 2, 1, 2)$

($\lfloor \cdots \rfloor$ is the floor-function.)

It can be proven that for any irrational $\alpha$ there exist
infinitely many values of $n$ such that the subsequence $
\{S\_\alpha(1),S\_\alpha(2)\...S\_\alpha(n) \} $ is palindromic.

The first $20$ values of $n$ that give a palindromic subsequence for

Let $H\_g(\alpha)$ be the sum of the first $g$ values of $n$ for
which the corresponding subsequence is palindromic.
So $H\_{20}(\sqrt{31})=150243655$.

Let $T=\{2,3,5,6,7,8,10,\dots,1000\}$ be the set of positive

In the context of **formal languages**, any finite sequence of letters
of a given **alphabet** $\Sigma$ is called a **word** over

Given an alphabet $\Sigma$ of $\alpha$ letters, we define

For example, the triangle $(217, 248, 403)$ is $9$-pandigital
because it contains one angle of $120$ degrees and the sides written
in base $9$ are $261\_9, 305\_9, 487\_9$ using each of the $9$

Two friends $A$ and $B$ are great fans of Chess. They both enjoy
playing the game, but after each game the player who lost the game would
like to continue (to get back at the other player) and the player who
won would prefer to stop (to finish on a high).

So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a
(biased) coin with probability $p$ of Heads (and hence probability
$1-p$ of Tails). If they get Tails, they will continue with the next
game. Otherwise they end the match. Also, after every game the players
make a note of who is leading in the match.

Let $p\_A$ denote the probability of $A$ winning a game and $p\_B$
the probability of $B$ winning a game. Accordingly $1-p\_A-p\_B$ is
the probability that a game ends in a draw. Let
$\mathbb{E}\_A(p\_A,p\_B,p)$ denote the expected number of times
$A$ was leading in the match.
For example, $\mathbb{E}\_A(0.25,0.25,0.5)\approx 0.585786$ and
$\mathbb{E}\_A(0.47,0.48,0.001)\approx 377.471736$, both rounded to

For a given integer $n$, let $A\_n$ be an array of length $n$

Peter is playing a solitaire game on an infinite checkerboard, each
square of which can hold an unlimited number of tokens.

Each move of the game consists of the following steps:

1.  Choose one token $T$ to move. This may be any token on the board,
    as long as not all of its four adjacent squares are empty.
2.  Select and discard one token $D$ from a square adjacent to that of
    $T$.
3.  Move $T$ to any one of its four adjacent squares (even if that
    square is already occupied).

Peter\'s goal is to get a token as far as possible to the right in a
finite number of moves. However, he quickly finds out that, even with
his infinite supply of tokens, he cannot move a token more than four
squares beyond the dividing line.

Peter then considers starting configurations with larger supplies of
tokens: each square in the $d$th column to the left of the dividing
line starts with $d^n$ tokens instead of $1$. This is illustrated

Problem 665
===========

Two players play a game with two piles of stones, alternating turns.

On each turn, the corresponding player chooses a positive integer $n$
and does one of the following:

-   removes $n$ stones from one pile;
-   removes $n$ stones from both piles; or
-   removes $n$ stones from one pile and $2n$ stones from the other
    pile.

The player who removes the last stone wins.

We denote by $(n,m)$ the position in which the piles have $n$ and
$m$ stones remaining. Note that $(n,m)$ is considered to be the same
position as $(m,n)$.

Then, for example, if the position is $(2,6)$, the next player may
reach the following positions:
$(0,2)$, $(0,4)$, $(0,5)$, $(0,6)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,4)$,
$(1,5)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(2,4)$, $(2,5)$

A position is a losing position if the player to move next cannot force
a win. For example, $(1,3)$, $(2,6)$, $(4,5)$ are the first few
losing positions.

Let $f(M)$ be the sum of $n+m$ for all losing positions $(n,m)$
with $n\le m$ and $n+m \le M$. For example, $f(10) = 21$, by
considering the losing positions $(1,3)$, $(2,6)$, $(4,5)$.

You are given that $f(100) = 1164$ and $f(1000) = 117002$.

Find $f(10^7)$.

Problem 666
===========

Members of a species of bacteria occur in two different types:
$\alpha$ and $\beta$. Individual bacteria are capable of
multiplying and mutating between the types according to the following
rules:

-   Every minute, each individual will simultaneously undergo some kind
    of transformation.
-   Each individual $A$ of type $\alpha$ will, independently, do
    one of the following (at random with equal probability):
    -   clone itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type $\alpha$
        (alongside $A$ who remains)
    -   split into 3 new bacteria of type $\beta$ (replacing $A$)
-   Each individual $B$ of type $\beta$ will, independently, do one
    of the following (at random with equal probability):
    -   spawn a new bacterium of type $\alpha$ (alongside $B$ who
        remains)
    -   die

If a population starts with a single bacterium of type $\alpha$, then
it can be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the
population will eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that
the population will last forever. These probabilities are given rounded
to 8 decimal places.

Now consider another species of bacteria, $S\_{k,m}$ (where $k$ and
$m$ are positive integers), which occurs in $k$ different types
$\alpha\_i$ for $0\le i\< k$. The rules governing this species\'
lifecycle involve the sequence $r\_n$ defined by:

-   $r\_0 = 306$
-   $r\_{n+1} = r\_n^2 \bmod 10\,007$

Every minute, for each $i$, each bacterium $A$ of type
$\alpha\_i$ will independently choose an integer $j$ uniformly at
random in the range $0\le j\<m$. What it then does depends on $q =
r\_{im+j} \bmod 5$:

-   If $q=0$, $A$ dies.
-   If $q=1$, $A$ clones itself, resulting in a new bacterium of
    type $\alpha\_i$ (alongside $A$ who remains).
-   If $q=2$, $A$ mutates, changing into type $\alpha\_{(2i)
    \bmod k}$.
-   If $q=3$, $A$ splits into 3 new bacteria of type
    $\alpha\_{(i^2+1) \bmod k}$ (replacing $A$).
-   If $q=4$, $A$ spawns a new bacterium of type $\alpha\_{(i+1)
    \bmod k}$ (alongside $A$ who remains).

In fact, our original species was none other than $S\_{2,2}$, with
$\alpha=\alpha\_0$ and $\beta=\alpha\_1$.

Let $P\_{k,m}$ be the probability that a population of species
$S\_{k,m}$, starting with a single bacterium of type $\alpha\_0$,
will eventually die out. So $P\_{2,2} = 0.07243802$. You are also
given that $P\_{4,3} = 0.18554021$ and $P\_{10,5} = 0.53466253$, all
rounded to 8 decimal places.

Find $P\_{500,10}$, and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places.

Problem 667
===========

After buying a *Gerver Sofa* from the *Moving Sofa Company*, Jack wants
to buy a matching cocktail table from the same company. Most important
for him is that the table can be pushed through his L-shaped corridor
into the living room without having to be lifted from its table legs.
Unfortunately, the simple square model offered to him is too small for
him, so he asks for a bigger model.
He is offered the new pentagonal model illustrated below:

![p667.png](project/images/p667_MovingPentagon.png)

Note, while the shape and size can be ordered individually, due to the
production process, **all edges of the pentagonal table have to have the
same length.**

Given optimal form and size, what is the biggest pentagonal cocktail
table (in terms of area) that Jack can buy that still fits through his
unit wide L-shaped corridor?

Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point (if Jack
had choosen the square model instead the answer would have been
1.0000000000).

Problem 669
===========

The Knights of the Order of Fibonacci are preparing a grand feast for
their king. There are $n$ knights, and each knight is assigned a
distinct number from $1$ to $n$.

When the knights sit down at the roundtable for their feast, they follow
a peculiar seating rule: two knights can only sit next to each other if
their respective numbers sum to a Fibonacci number.

When the $n$ knights all try to sit down around a circular table with
$n$ chairs, they are unable to find a suitable seating arrangement for
any $n\>2$ despite their best efforts. Just when they are about to
give up, they remember that the king will sit on his throne at the table
as well.

Suppose there are $n=7$ knights and $7$ chairs at the roundtable, in
addition to the king's throne. After some trial and error, they come up
with the following seating arrangement ($K$ represents the king):

::: {.center}
![Roundtable](resources/images/0669_roundtable.png?1678992054)
:::

Notice that the sums $4+1$, $1+7$, $7+6$, $6+2$, $2+3$, and
$3+5$ are all Fibonacci numbers, as required. It should also be
mentioned that the king always prefers an arrangement where the knight
to the his left has a smaller number than the knight to his right. With
this additional rule, the above arrangement is unique for $n=7$, and
the knight sitting in the 3rd chair from the king's left is knight
number $7$.

Later, several new knights are appointed to the Order, giving $34$
knights and chairs in addition to the king\'s throne. The knights
eventually determine that there is a unique seating arrangement for
$n=34$ satisfying the above rules, and this time knight number $30$
is sitting in the 3rd chair from the king\'s left.

Now suppose there are $n=99\,194\,853\,094\,755\,497$ knights and
the same number of chairs at the roundtable (not including the king's
throne). After great trials and tribulations, they are finally able to
find the unique seating arrangement for this value of $n$ that
satisfies the above rules.

Find the number of the knight sitting in the
$10\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000$th chair from the king's left.

Problem 670
===========

A certain type of tile comes in three different sizes - $1 \times 1$,
$1 \times 2$, and $1 \times 3$ - and in four different colours:
blue, green, red and yellow. There is an unlimited number of tiles
available in each combination of size and colour.

These are used to tile a $2\times n$ rectangle, where $n$ is a
positive integer, subject to the following conditions:

-   The rectangle must be fully covered by non-overlapping tiles.
-   It is *not* permitted for four tiles to have their corners meeting
    at a single point.
-   Adjacent tiles must be of different colours.

For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\times 12$
rectangle:

::: {.center}
![Acceptable

Let $F(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\times n$ rectangle can be
tiled subject to these rules. Where reflecting horizontally or
vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be
counted separately.

For example, $F(2) = 120$, $F(5) = 45876$, and $F(100)\equiv
53275818 \pmod{1\,000\,004\,321}$.

A certain type of flexible tile comes in three different sizes - $1
\times 1$, $1 \times 2$, and $1 \times 3$ - and in $k$
different colours. There is an unlimited number of tiles available in
each combination of size and colour.

These are used to tile a closed loop of width $2$ and length
(circumference) $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the
following conditions:

-   The loop must be fully covered by non-overlapping tiles.
-   It is *not* permitted for four tiles to have their corners meeting
    at a single point.
-   Adjacent tiles must be of different colours.

For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\times 23$
loop with $k=4$ (blue, green, red and yellow):

::: {.center}
![Acceptable

Let $F\_k(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\times n$ loop can be
tiled subject to these rules when $k$ colours are available. (Not all
$k$ colours have to be used.) Where reflecting horizontally or

For example, $F\_4(3) = 104$, $F\_5(7) = 3327300$, and
$F\_6(101)\equiv 75309980 \pmod{1\,000\,004\,321}$.

Problem 672
===========

Consider the following process that can be applied recursively to any
positive integer $n$:

-   if $n = 1$ do nothing and the process stops,
-   if $n$ is divisible by $7$ divide it by $7$,
-   otherwise add $1$.

Define $g(n)$ to be the number of $1$\'s that must be added before
the process ends. For example:

$125\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}} 126\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{\div
7}} 18\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}} 19\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}}
20\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}} 21\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{\div 7}}
3\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}} 4\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}}
5\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}} 6\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{+1}}
7\xrightarrow{\scriptsize{\div 7}} 1$.

Eight $1$\'s are added so $g(125) = 8$. Similarly $g(1000) = 9$
and $g(10000) = 21$.

Define $S(N) = \sum\_{n=1}^N g(n)$ and $H(K) =
S\left(\frac{7^K-1}{11}\right)$. You are given $H(10) =

Problem 673
===========

At Euler University, each of the $n$ students (numbered from 1 to
$n$) occupies a bed in the dormitory and uses a desk in the classroom.

Some of the beds are in private rooms which a student occupies alone,
while the others are in double rooms occupied by two students as
roommates. Similarly, each desk is either a single desk for the sole use
of one student, or a twin desk at which two students sit together as
desk partners.

We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of
pairs of student numbers. For example, with $n=4$, if $(2,3)$
represents the bed pairing and $(1,3)(2,4)$ the desk pairing, then
students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and
students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.

The new chancellor of the university decides to change the organisation
of beds and desks: a permutation $\sigma$ of the numbers
$1,2,\ldots,n$ will be chosen, and each student $k$ will be given
both the bed and the desk formerly occupied by student number
$\sigma(k)$.

The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:

1.  Any two students currently sharing a room will still be roommates.
2.  Any two students currently sharing a desk will still be desk
    partners.

In the example above, there are only two ways to satisfy these
conditions: either take no action ($\sigma$ is the **identity
permutation**), or reverse the order of the students.

With $n=6$, for the bed pairing $(1,2)(3,4)(5,6)$ and the desk
pairing $(3,6)(4,5)$, there are 8 permutations which satisfy the
conditions. One example is the mapping $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \mapsto (1,
2, 5, 6, 3, 4)$.

With $n=36$, if we have bed pairing:
$(2,13)(4,30)(5,27)(6,16)(10,18)(12,35)(14,19)(15,20)(17,26)(21,32)(22,33)(24,34)(25,28)$
and desk pairing
$(1,35)(2,22)(3,36)(4,28)(5,25)(7,18)(9,23)(13,19)(14,33)(15,34)(20,24)(26,29)(27,30)$
then among the $36!$ possible permutations (including the identity
permutation), 663552 of them satisfy the conditions stipulated by the
students.

The downloadable text files
[beds.txt](resources/documents/0673_beds.txt) and
[desks.txt](resources/documents/0673_desks.txt) contain pairings for
$n=500$. Each pairing is written on its own line, with the student
numbers of the two roommates (or desk partners) separated with a comma.
For example, the desk pairing in the $n=4$ example above would be
represented in this file format as:

    1,3
    2,4

With these pairings, find the number of permutations that satisfy the
students\' conditions. Give your answer modulo $999\,999\,937$.

Problem 674
===========

We define the $\mathcal{I}$ operator as the function
\\[\mathcal{I}(x,y) = (1+x+y)^2+y-x\\] and
$\mathcal{I}$-expressions as arithmetic expressions built only from
variable names and applications of $\mathcal{I}$. A variable name may
consist of one or more letters. For example, the three expressions
$x$, $\mathcal{I}(x,y)$, and $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(x,ab),x)$
are all $\mathcal{I}$-expressions.

For two $\mathcal{I}$-expressions $e\_1$ and $e\_2$ such that the
equation $e\_1=e\_2$ has a solution in non-negative integers, we
define the least simultaneous value of $e\_1$ and $e\_2$ to be the
minimum value taken by $e\_1$ and $e\_2$ on such a solution. If the
equation $e\_1=e\_2$ has no solution in non-negative integers, we
define the least simultaneous value of $e\_1$ and $e\_2$ to be
$0$. For example, consider the following three
$\mathcal{I}$-expressions: \\[\begin{array}{l}A =
\mathcal{I}(x,\mathcal{I}(z,t))\\ B =
\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(y,z),y)\\ C =
\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{I}(x,z),y)\end{array}\\] The least simultaneous
value of $A$ and $B$ is $23$, attained for $x=3,y=1,z=t=0$. On
the other hand, $A=C$ has no solutions in non-negative integers, so
the least simultaneous value of $A$ and $C$ is $0$. The total sum
of least simultaneous pairs made of $\mathcal{I}$-expressions from
$\{A,B,C\}$ is $26$.

Find the sum of least simultaneous values of all
$\mathcal{I}$-expressions pairs made of distinct expressions from
file [I-expressions.txt](project/resources/p674_i_expressions.txt)
(pairs $(e\_1,e\_2)$ and $(e\_2,e\_1)$ are considered to be
identical). Give the last nine digits of the result as the answer.

positive integer $n$.
So $\omega(1) = 0$ and $\omega(360) = \omega(2^{3} \times 3^{2}

Let $S(n)$ be $ \sum\_{d \mid n} 2^{\omega(d)} $.
E.g. $S(6) =

Problem 676
===========

Let $d(i,b)$ be the **digit sum** of the number $i$ in base $b$.
For example $d(9,2)=2$, since $9=1001\_2$. When using different
bases, the respective digit sums most of the time deviate from each
other, for example $d(9,4)=3 \ne d(9,2)$.

However, for some numbers $i$ there will be a match, like
$d(17,4)=d(17,2)=2$. Let $ M(n,b\_1,b\_2)$ be the sum of all natural
numbers $i \le n$ for which $d(i,b\_1)=d(i,b\_2)$. For example,
$M(10,8,2)=18$, $M(100,8,2)=292$ and $M(10^6,8,2)=19173952$.

Find $\displaystyle \sum\_{k=3}^6

Let $g(n)$ be the number of **undirected graphs** with $n$ nodes
satisfying the following properties:

-   The graph is connected and has no cycles or multiple edges.
-   Each node is either red, blue, or yellow.
-   A red node may have no more than 4 edges connected to it.
-   A blue or yellow node may have no more than 3 edges connected to it.
-   An edge may not directly connect a yellow node to a yellow node.

For example, $g(2)=5$, $g(3)=15$, and $g(4) = 57$.
You are also given that $g(10) = 710249$ and $g(100) \equiv

If a triple of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ satisfies
$a^2+b^2=c^2$, it is called a Pythagorean triple. No triple $(a,
b, c)$ satisfies $a^e+b^e=c^e$ when $e \ge 3$ (Fermat\'s Last
Theorem). However, if the exponents of the left-hand side and right-hand
side differ, this is not true. For example, $3^3+6^3=3^5$.

Let $a, b, c, e, f$ be all positive integers, $0 \lt a \lt b$, $e
\ge 2$, $f \ge 3$ and $c^f \le N$. Let $F(N)$ be the number
of $(a, b, c, e, f)$ such that $a^e+b^e=c^f$. You are given

We designate the words $\texttt{FREE}, \texttt{FARE}, \texttt{AREA},
\texttt{REEF}$ as *keywords*.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of words in $S^\*(n)$ that contains all
four keywords exactly once.

This first happens for $n=9$, and indeed there is a unique 9 lettered

So, $f(9)=1$.

Let $N$ and $K$ be two positive integers.

$F\_n$ is the $n$-th Fibonacci number: $F\_1 = F\_2 = 1$, $F\_n =
F\_{n - 1} + F\_{n - 2}$ for all $n \geq 3$.
Let $s\_n = F\_{2n - 1} \bmod N$ and let $t\_n = F\_{2n} \bmod N$.

Start with an array of integers $A = (A\[0\], \cdots, A\[N - 1\])$
where initially every $A\text{\[}i\]$ is equal to $i$. Now perform
$K$ successive operations on $A$, where the $j$-th operation
consists of reversing the order of those elements in $A$ with indices
between $s\_j$ and $t\_j$ (both ends inclusive).

Define $R(N,K)$ to be $\sum\_{i = 0}^{N - 1}i \times A\text
{\[}i\]$ after $K$ operations.

For example, $R(5, 4) = 27$, as can be seen from the following
procedure:

Initial position: $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)$
Step 1 - Reverse $A\[1\]$ to $A\[1\]$: $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)$
Step 2 - Reverse $A\[2\]$ to $A\[3\]$: $(0, 1, 3, 2, 4)$
Step 3 - Reverse $A\[0\]$ to $A\[3\]$: $(2, 3, 1, 0, 4)$
Step 4 - Reverse $A\[3\]$ to $A\[1\]$: $(2, 0, 1, 3, 4)$
$R(5, 4) = 0 \times 2 + 1 \times 0 + 2 \times 1 + 3 \times 3 + 4
\times 4 = 27$

Also, $R(10^2, 10^2) = 246597$ and $R(10^4, 10^4) =

For example, $M(2,2,3,3)=6$, attained e.g. by a $2\times 3$

$5$-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn\'t
exceed $5$.
$5$-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.

Let $\Omega(a)$ be the count of prime factors of $a$ (counted with

Let $s(a)$ be the sum of the prime factors of $a$ (with
multiplicity).
For example, $\Omega(300) = 5$ and $s(300) = 2+2+3+5+5 = 17$.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs, $(p,q)$, of Hamming numbers such
that $\Omega(p)=\Omega(q)$ and $s(p)+s(q)=n$.

Problem 683
===========

Consider the following variant of \"The Chase\" game. This game is
played between $n$ players sitting around a circular table using two
dice. It consists of $n-1$ rounds, and at the end of each round one
player is eliminated and has to pay a certain amount of money into a
pot. The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire
contents of the pot.

At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly selected
player. A round then consists of a number of turns.

During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it. If a
player rolls a 1 or a 2, the die is passed to the neighbour on the left;
if the player rolls a 5 or a 6, the die is passed to the neighbour on
the right; otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.

The round ends when one player has both dice at the beginning of a turn.
At which point that player is immediately eliminated and has to pay
$s^2$ where $s$ is the number of completed turns in this round.
Note that if both dice happen to be handed to the same player at the
beginning of a round, then no turns are completed, so the player is
eliminated without having to pay any money into the pot.

Let $G(n)$ be the expected amount that the winner will receive. For
example $G(5)$ is approximately 96.544, and $G(50)$ is 2.82491788e6
in scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.

$S(20) = 1074$.

Further let $f\_i$ be the Fibonacci sequence defined by $f\_0=0,

Writing down the numbers which have a digit sum of 10 in ascending
order, we get: $19, 28, 37, 46,55,64,73,82,91,109, 118,\dots$

Let $f(n,m)$ be the $m^{\text{th}}$ occurrence of the digit sum
$n$. For example, $f(10,1)=19$, $f(10,10)=109$ and
$f(10,100)=1423$.

Let $\displaystyle S(k)=\sum\_{n=1}^k f(n^3,n^4)$. For example
$S(3)=7128$ and $S(10)\equiv 32287064 \mod 1\,000\,000\,007$.

Find $S(10\,000)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 686
===========

$2^7=128$ is the first power of two whose leading digits are \"12\".
The next power of two whose leading digits are \"12\" is $2^{80}$.

Define $p(L, n)$ to be the $n$th-smallest value of $j$ such that
the base 10 representation of $2^j$ begins with the digits of $L$.
So $p(12, 1) = 7$ and $p(12, 2) = 80$.

You are also given that $p(123, 45) = 12710$.

Find $p(123, 678910)$.

Problem 687
===========

A standard deck of $52$ playing cards, which consists of thirteen
ranks (Ace, Two, \..., Ten, King, Queen and Jack) each in four suits
(Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades), is randomly shuffled. Let us call
a rank [perfect]{.dfn} if no two cards of that same rank appear next to
each other after the shuffle.

It can be seen that the expected number of ranks that are perfect after
a random shuffle equals $\frac {4324} {425} \approx 10.1741176471$.

Find the probability that the number of perfect ranks is prime. Give
your answer rounded to $10$ decimal places.

Problem 688
===========

We stack $n$ plates into $k$ non-empty piles where each pile is a
different size. Define $f(n,k)$ to be the maximum number of plates
possible in the smallest pile. For example when $n = 10$ and $k = 3$
the piles $2,3,5$ is the best that can be done and so $f(10,3) = 2$.
It is impossible to divide 10 into 5 non-empty differently-sized piles
and hence $f(10,5) = 0$.

Define $F(n)$ to be the sum of $f(n,k)$ for all possible pile sizes
$k\ge 1$. For example $F(100) = 275$.

Further define $S(N) = \displaystyle\sum\_{n=1}^N F(n)$. You are
given $S(100) = 12656$.

Find $S(10^{16})$ giving your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 689
===========

For $0 \le x \lt 1$, define $d\_i(x)$ to be the $i$th digit
after the binary point of the binary representation of $x$.
For example $d\_2(0.25) = 1$, $d\_i(0.25) = 0$ for $i \ne 2$.

Let $f(x) =
\displaystyle{\sum\_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{d\_i(x)}{i^2}}$.

Let $p(a)$ be probability that $f(x) \gt a$, given that $x$ is
uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$.

Find $p(0.5)$. Give your answer rounded to $8$ digits after the
decimal point.

Problem 690
===========

Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) are playing on a simple graph $G$.

Every vertex of $G$ is a mousehole, and every edge of $G$ is a
tunnel connecting two mouseholes.

Originally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.
Every morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If
Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is
over.
Every evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which
is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to
his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game
continues like this.

Let us call a graph $G$ a [Tom graph]{.dfn}, if our super-smart Tom,
who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location
of Jerry, can *guarantee* to catch Jerry in finitely many days. For
example consider all graphs on 3 nodes:

::: {.center}
![Graphs on 3 nodes](resources/images/0690_graphs.jpg?1678992054)
:::

For graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For
graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and
hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs
are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because
the game could potentially continue forever.

Let $T(n)$ be the number of different Tom graphs with $n$ vertices.
Two graphs are considered the same if there is a bijection $f$ between
their vertices, such that $(v,w)$ is an edge if and only if
$(f(v),f(w))$ is an edge.

We have $T(3) = 3$, $T(7) = 37$, $T(10) = 328$ and $T(20) =
1416269$.

Find $T(2019)$ giving your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 691
===========

Given a character string $s$, we define $L(k,s)$ to be the length of
the longest substring of $s$ which appears at least $k$ times in
$s$, or $0$ if such a substring does not exist. For example,
$L(3,\text{"bbabcabcabcacba"})=4$ because of the three occurrences of
the substring $\text{"abca"}$, and
$L(2,\text{"bbabcabcabcacba"})=7$ because of the repeated substring
$\text{"abcabca"}$. Note that the occurrences can overlap.

Let $a\_n$, $b\_n$ and $c\_n$ be the $0/1$ sequences defined by:

-   $a\_0 = 0$
-   $a\_{2n} = a\_{n}$
-   $a\_{2n+1} = 1-a\_{n}$
-   $b\_n = \lfloor\frac{n+1}{\varphi}\rfloor -
    \lfloor\frac{n}{\varphi}\rfloor$ (where $\varphi$ is the
    golden ratio)
-   $c\_n = a\_n + b\_n - 2a\_nb\_n$

and $S\_n$ the character string $c\_0\ldots c\_{n-1}$. You are
given that $L(2,S\_{10})=5$, $L(3,S\_{10})=2$, $L(2,S\_{100})=14$,
$L(4,S\_{100})=6$, $L(2,S\_{1000})=86$, $L(3,S\_{1000}) = 45$,
$L(5,S\_{1000}) = 31$, and that the sum of non-zero $L(k,S\_{1000})$
for $k\ge 1$ is $2460$.

Find the sum of non-zero $L(k,S\_{5000000})$ for $k\ge 1$.

Problem 692
===========

Siegbert and Jo take turns playing a game with a heap of $N$ pebbles:
1. Siegbert is the first to take some pebbles. He can take as many
pebbles as he wants. (Between 1 and $N$ inclusive.)
2. In each of the following turns the current player must take at least
one pebble and at most twice the amount of pebbles taken by the previous
player.
3. The player who takes the last pebble wins.

Although Siegbert can always win by taking all the pebbles on his first
turn, to make the game more interesting he chooses to take the smallest
number of pebbles that guarantees he will still win (assuming both
Siegbert and Jo play optimally for the rest of the game).

Let $H(N)$ be that minimal amount for a heap of $N$ pebbles.
$H(1)=1$, $H(4)=1$, $H(17)=1$, $H(8)=8$ and $H(18)=5$ .

Let $G(n)$ be $\displaystyle{\sum\_{k=1}^n H(k)}$.
$G(13)=43$.

Find $G(23416728348467685)$.

Problem 693
===========

Two positive integers $x$ and $y$ ($x \> y$) can generate a
sequence in the following manner:

-   $a\_x = y$ is the first term,
-   $a\_{z+1} = a\_z^2 \bmod z$ for $z = x, x+1,x+2,\ldots$ and
-   the generation stops when a term becomes $0$ or $1$.

The number of terms in this sequence is denoted $l(x,y)$.

For example, with $x = 5$ and $y = 3$, we get $a\_5 = 3$, $a\_6 =
3^2 \bmod 5 = 4$, $a\_7 = 4^2\bmod 6 = 4$, etc. Giving the
sequence of 29 terms:
$ 3,4,4,2,4,7,9,4,4,3,9,6,4,16,4,16,16,4,16,3,9,6,10,19,25,16,16,8,0
$
Hence $l(5,3) = 29$.

$g(x)$ is defined to be the maximum value of $l(x,y)$ for $y \lt
x$. For example, $g(5) = 29$.

Further, define $f(n)$ to be the maximum value of $g(x)$ for $x
\le n$. For example, $f(100) = 145$ and $f(10\,000) = 8824$.

Find $f(3\,000\,000)$.

Problem 694
===========

A positive integer $n$ is considered [cube-full]{.dfn}, if for every
prime $p$ that divides $n$, so does $p^3$. Note that $1$ is
considered cube-full.

Let $s(n)$ be the function that counts the number of cube-full
divisors of $n$. For example, $1$, $8$ and $16$ are the three
cube-full divisors of $16$. Therefore, $s(16)=3$.

Let $S(n)$ represent the summatory function of $s(n)$, that is
$S(n)=\displaystyle\sum\_{i=1}^n s(i)$.

You are given $S(16) = 19$, $S(100) = 126$ and $S(10000) = 13344$.

Find $S(10^{18})$.

Problem 695
===========

Three points, $P\_1$, $P\_2$ and $P\_3$, are randomly selected
within a unit square. Consider the three rectangles with sides parallel
to the sides of the unit square and a diagonal that is one of the three
line segments $\overline{P\_1P\_2}$, $\overline{P\_1P\_3}$ or
$\overline{P\_2P\_3}$ (see picture below).

::: {.center}
![3 random rectangles](project/images/p695_randrect.png)

We are interested in the rectangle with the second biggest area. In the
example above that happens to be the green rectangle defined with the
diagonal $\overline{P\_2P\_3}$.

Find the expected value of the area of the second biggest of the three
rectangles. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal
point.

Problem 696
===========

The game of Mahjong is played with tiles belonging to $s$
[suits]{.dfn}. Each tile also has a [number]{.dfn} in the range
$1\ldots n$, and for each suit/number combination there are exactly
four indistinguishable tiles with that suit and number. (The real
Mahjong game also contains other bonus tiles, but those will not feature
in this problem.)

A [winning hand]{.dfn} is a collection of $3t+2$ Tiles (where $t$ is
a fixed integer) that can be arranged as $t$ [Triples]{.dfn} and one
[Pair]{.dfn}, where:

-   A [Triple]{.dfn} is either a [Chow]{.dfn} or a [Pung]{.dfn}
-   A [Chow]{.dfn} is three tiles of the same suit and consecutive
    numbers
-   A [Pung]{.dfn} is three identical tiles (same suit and same number)
-   A [Pair]{.dfn} is two identical tiles (same suit and same number)

For example, here is a winning hand with $n=9$, $s=3$, $t=4$,
consisting in this case of two Chows, two Pungs, and one Pair:

::: {.center}
![A winning Mahjong
hand](resources/images/0696_mahjong_1.png?1678992054)
:::

Note that sometimes the same collection of tiles can be represented as
$t$ Triples and one Pair in more than one way. This only counts as one
winning hand. For example, this is considered to be the same winning
hand as above, because it consists of the same tiles:

::: {.center}
![Alternative arrangement of the same
hand](resources/images/0696_mahjong_2.png?1678992054)
:::

Let $w(n, s, t)$ be the number of distinct winning hands formed of
$t$ Triples and one Pair, where there are $s$ suits available and
tiles are numbered up to $n$.

For example, with a single suit and tiles numbered up to $4$, we have
$w(4, 1, 1) = 20$: there are $12$ winning hands consisting of a Pung
and a Pair, and another $8$ containing a Chow and a Pair. You are also
given that $w(9, 1, 4) = 13259$, $w(9, 3, 4) = 5237550$, and
$w(1000, 1000, 5) \equiv 107662178 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.

Find $w(10^8, 10^8, 30)$. Give your answer modulo
$1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 697
===========

Given a fixed real number $c$, define a random sequence
$(X\_n)\_{n\ge 0}$ by the following random process:

-   $X\_0 = c$ (with probability 1).
-   For $n\>0$, $X\_n = U\_n X\_{n-1}$ where $U\_n$ is a real
    number chosen at random between zero and one, uniformly, and
    independently of all previous choices $(U\_m)\_{m\<n}$.

If we desire there to be precisely a 25% probability that
$X\_{100}\<1$, then this can be arranged by fixing $c$ such that
$\log\_{10} c \approx 46.27$.

Suppose now that $c$ is set to a different value, so that there is
precisely a 25% probability that $X\_{10\,000\,000}\<1$.

Find $\log\_{10} c$ and give your answer rounded to two places after
the decimal point.

Problem 698
===========

We define *123-numbers* as follows:

-   1 is the smallest 123-number.
-   When written in base 10 the only digits that can be present are
    \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" and if present the number of times they each
    occur is also a 123-number.

So 2 is a 123-number, since it consists of one digit \"2\" and 1 is a
123-number. Therefore, 33 is a 123-number as well since it consists of
two digits \"3\" and 2 is a 123-number.
On the other hand, 1111 is not a 123-number, since it contains 4 digits
\"1\" and 4 is not a 123-number.

In ascending order, the first 123-numbers are:
$1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 111, 112, 113, 121, 122,
123, 131, \ldots$

Let $F(n)$ be the $n$-th 123-number. For example $F(4)=11$,
$F(10)=31$, $F(40)=1112$, $F(1000)=1223321$ and $F(6000)=
2333333333323$.

Find $F(111\,111\,111\,111\,222\,333)$. Give your answer modulo
$123\,123\,123$.

Problem 699

Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of all the divisors of the positive
integer $n$, for example:
$\sigma(10) = 1+2+5+10 = 18$.

Define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n \le N$ such that when
the fraction $\frac{\sigma(n)}{n}$ is written in its lowest form
$\frac ab$, the denominator is a power of 3 i.e. $b = 3^k, k \>
0$.

You are given $T(100) = 270$ and $T(10^6) = 26089287$.

Find $T(10^{14})$.

Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707.

Consider the sequence 1504170715041707`n`{.variable} mod
4503599627370517.

An element of this sequence is defined to be an Eulercoin if it is
strictly smaller than all previously found Eulercoins.

For example, the first term is 1504170715041707 which is the first
Eulercoin. The second term is 3008341430083414 which is greater than
1504170715041707 so is not an Eulercoin. However, the third term is
8912517754604 which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.

The sum of the first 2 Eulercoins is therefore 1513083232796311.

Find the sum of all Eulercoins.

Problem 701

Consider a rectangle made up of $W \times H$ square cells each with
area $1$.
Each cell is independently coloured black with probability $0.5$
otherwise white. Black cells sharing an edge are assumed to be

Find $E(7, 7)$, rounded to $8$ decimal places.

Problem 702
===========

A regular hexagon table of side length $N$ is divided into equilateral
triangles of side length $1$. The picture below is an illustration of
the case $N = 3$.

::: {.center}
![hexagonal table](project/images/p702_jumping_flea.png)
:::

An flea of negligible size is jumping on this table. The flea starts at
the centre of the table. Thereafter, at each step, it chooses one of the
six corners of the table, and jumps to the mid-point between its current
position and the chosen corner.

For every triangle $T$, we denote by $J(T)$ the minimum number of
jumps required for the flea to reach the interior of $T$. Landing on
an edge or vertex of $T$ is not sufficient.

For example, $J(T) = 3$ for the triangle marked with a star in the
picture: by jumping from the centre half way towards F, then towards C,
then towards E.

Let $S(N)$ be the sum of $J(T)$ for all the upper-pointing triangles
$T$ in the upper half of the table. For the case $N = 3$, these are
the triangles painted black in the above picture.

You are given that $S(3) = 42$, $S(5) = 126$, $S(123) = 167178$,

Given an integer $n$, $n \geq 3$, let
$B=\{\mathrm{false},\mathrm{true}\}$ and let $B^n$ be the set
of sequences of $n$ values from $B$. The function $f$ from

Problem 704
===========

Define $g(n, m)$ to be the largest integer $k$ such that $2^k$
divides $\binom{n}m$. For example, $\binom{12}5 = 792 = 2^3 \cdot
3^2 \cdot 11$, hence $g(12, 5) = 3$. Then define $F(n) = \max \{
g(n, m) : 0 \le m \le n \}$. $F(10) = 3$ and $F(100) = 6$.

Problem 705
===========

The [inversion count]{.dfn} of a sequence of digits is the smallest
number of adjacent pairs that must be swapped to sort the sequence.
For example, $34214$ has inversion count of $5$: $34214 \to 32414
\to 23414 \to 23144 \to 21344 \to12344$.

If each digit of a sequence is replaced by one of its divisors a
[divided sequence]{.dfn} is obtained.
For example, the sequence $332$ has $8$ divided sequences:
$\{332,331,312,311,132,131,112,111\}$.

Define $G(N)$ to be the concatenation of all primes less than $N$,
ignoring any zero digit.
For example, $G(20) = 235711131719$.

Define $F(N)$ to be the sum of the inversion count for all possible
divided sequences from the master sequence $G(N)$.
You are given $F(20) = 3312$ and $F(50) = 338079744$.

Problem 706

For a positive integer $n$, define $f(n)$ to be the number of
non-empty substrings of $n$ that are divisible by $3$. For example,
the string \"2573\" has $10$ non-empty substrings, three of which
represent numbers that are divisible by $3$, namely $57$, $573$
and $3$. So $f(2573) = 3$.

If $f(n)$ is divisible by $3$ then we say that $n$ is
[$3$-like]{.dfn}.

Define $F(d)$ to be how many $d$ digit numbers are $3$-like. For
example, $F(2) = 30$ and $F(6) = 290898$.

Problem 708
===========

A positive integer, $n$, is factorised into prime factors. We define
$f(n)$ to be the product when each prime factor is replaced with
$2$. In addition we define $f(1)=1$.

For example, $90 = 2\times 3\times 3\times 5$, then replacing the
primes, $2\times 2\times 2\times 2 = 16$, hence $f(90) = 16$.

Every day for the past $n$ days Even Stevens brings home his groceries
in a plastic bag. He stores these plastic bags in a cupboard. He either
puts the plastic bag into the cupboard with the rest, or else he takes
an **even** number of the existing bags (which may either be empty or
previously filled with other bags themselves) and places these into the
current bag.

After 4 days there are 5 possible packings and if the bags are numbered
1 (oldest), 2, 3, 4, they are:

-   Four empty bags,
-   1 and 2 inside 3, 4 empty,
-   1 and 3 inside 4, 2 empty,
-   1 and 2 inside 4, 3 empty,
-   2 and 3 inside 4, 1 empty.

Note that 1, 2, 3 inside 4 is invalid because every bag must contain an
even number of bags.

Define $f(n)$ to be the number of possible packings of $n$ bags.
Hence $f(4)=5$. You are also given $f(8)=1\,385$.

Problem 710
===========

#### On Sunday 5 April 2020 the Project Euler membership first exceeded one million members. We would like to present this problem to celebrate that milestone. Thank you to everyone for being a part of Project Euler.

The number 6 can be written as a palindromic sum in exactly eight
different ways:

$$(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (2, 1,
1, 2), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3), (6)$$

We shall define a [twopal]{.dfn} to be a palindromic tuple having at
least one element with a value of 2. It should also be noted that
elements are not restricted to single digits. For example, $(3, 2, 13,
6, 13, 2, 3)$ is a valid twopal.

If we let $t(n)$ be the number of twopals whose elements sum to $n$,
then it can be seen that $t(6) = 4$:

Similarly, $t(20) = 824$.

In searching for the answer to the ultimate question of life, the
universe, and everything, it can be verified that $t(42) = 1999923$,
which happens to be the first value of $t(n)$ that exceeds one
million.

However, your challenge to the \"ultimatest\" question of life, the

Problem 711
===========

Oscar and Eric play the following game. First, they agree on a positive
integer $n$, and they begin by writing its binary representation on a
blackboard. They then take turns, with Oscar going first, to write a
number on the blackboard in binary representation, such that the sum of
all written numbers does not exceed $2n$.

The game ends when there are no valid moves left. Oscar wins if the
number of $1$s on the blackboard is odd, and Eric wins if it is even.

Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all $n \le 2^N$ for which Eric can
guarantee winning, assuming optimal play.

For example, the first few values of $n$ for which Eric can guarantee
winning are $1,3,4,7,15,16$. Hence $S(4)=46$.

Problem 713
===========

Turan has the electrical water heating system outside his house in a
shed. The electrical system uses two fuses in series, one in the house
and one in the shed. (Nowadays old fashioned fuses are often replaced
with reusable mini circuit breakers, but Turan\'s system still uses old
fashioned fuses.) For the heating system to work both fuses must work.

Turan has $N$ fuses. He knows that $m$ of them are working and the
rest are blown. However, he doesn\'t know which ones are blown. So he
tries different combinations until the heating system turns on.
We denote by $T(N,m)$ the smallest number of tries required to
*ensure* the heating system turns on.
$T(3,2)=3$ and $T(8,4)=7$.

Let $L(N)$ be the sum of all $T(N, m)$ for $2 \leq m \leq N$.

Problem 714
===========

We call a natural number a [duodigit]{.dfn} if its decimal
representation uses no more than two different digits. For example,
$12$, $110$ and $33333$ are duodigits, while $102$ is not.
It can be shown that every natural number has duodigit multiples. Let
$d(n)$ be the smallest (positive) multiple of the number $n$ that
happens to be a duodigit. For example, $d(12)=12$, $d(102)=1122$,
$d(103)=515$, $d(290)=11011010$ and $d(317)=211122$.

example, we had asked for $D(500)$ instead, the answer format would
have been 2.957098800000e7.

Problem 716
===========

Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of $H\times
W$ nodes. The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between
adjacent nodes. $W$ vertical directed lines are drawn and all the
edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, $H$ horizontal
directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that
direction.

Two nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are **strongly
connected** if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from
$A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is
strongly connected to itself.

A **strongly connected component** in a directed graph is a non-empty
set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:

-   All nodes in $M$ are strongly connected to each other.
-   $M$ is maximal, in the sense that no node in $M$ is strongly
    connected to any node outside of $M$.

There are $2^H\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each
way gives a directed graph $\mathcal{G}$. We define
$S(\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in
$\mathcal{G}$.

The illustration below shows a directed graph with $H=3$ and $W=4$
that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated
by the different colours).

Problem 717
===========

For an odd prime $p$, define $f(p) =
\left\lfloor\frac{2^{(2^p)}}{p}\right\rfloor\bmod{2^p}$
For example, when $p=3$, $\lfloor 2^8/3\rfloor = 85 \equiv 5
\pmod 8$ and so $f(3) = 5$.

Further define $g(p) = f(p)\bmod p$. You are given $g(31) = 17$.

Now define $G(N)$ to be the summation of $g(p)$ for all odd primes

For a given $p$ there are some values of $n \> 0$ for which the
equation cannot be solved. We call these [unreachable values]{.dfn}.

Define $G(p)$ to be the sum of all unreachable values of $n$ for the
given value of $p$. For example $G(1) = 8253$ and $G(2)=
60258000$.

Find $G(6)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

Problem 719
===========

We define an $S$-number to be a natural number, $n$, that is a
perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the
decimal representation of $n$ into $2$ or more numbers then adding
the numbers.

For example, $81$ is an $S$-number because $\sqrt{81} = 8+1$.
$6724$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{6724} = 6+72+4$.
$8281$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81 = 82+8+1$.
$9801$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{9801}=98+0+1$.

N$. You are given $T(10^4) = 41333$.

Let us call a permutation $P$ [unpredictable]{.dfn} if there is no
choice of three indices $i \lt j \lt k$ such that $P(i)$, $P(j)$
and $P(k)$ constitute an arithmetic progression.
For example, $P=(3, 4, 2, 1)$ is *not* unpredictable because $P(1),
P(3), P(4)$ is an arithmetic progression.

Let $S(N)$ be the position within the list of the first unpredictable
permutation.

For example, given $N = 4$, the first unpredictable permutation is
$(1, 3, 2, 4)$ so $S(4) = 3$.
You are also given that $S(8) = 2295$ and $S(32) \equiv 641839205

powers of the positive divisors of $n$.

It can be shown that, for every $k$, the series $E\_k(q)$ converges
for any $0 \< q \< 1$.

For example,
$E\_1(1 - \frac{1}{2^4}) = 3.872155809243\mathrm e2$
$E\_3(1 - \frac{1}{2^8}) = 2.767385314772\mathrm e10$

Problem 723
===========

A pythagorean triangle with catheti $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$
is characterized by the well-known equation $a^2+b^2=c^2$. However,
this can also be formulated differently:
When inscribed into a circle with radius $r$, a triangle with sides
$a$, $b$ and $c$ is pythagorean, if and only if
$a^2+b^2+c^2=8\, r^2$.

Analogously, we call a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with sides $a$, $b$,
$c$ and $d$, inscribed in a circle with radius $r$, a *pythagorean
quadrilateral*, if $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=8\, r^2$.
We further call a pythagorean quadrilateral a [pythagorean lattice grid
quadrilateral]{.dfn}, if all four vertices are lattice grid points with
the same distance $r$ from the origin $O$ (which then happens to be
the centre of the circumcircle).

Let $f(r)$ be the number of different pythagorean lattice grid
quadrilaterals for which the radius of the circumcircle is $r$. For
example $f(1)=1$, $f(\sqrt 2)=1$, $f(\sqrt 5)=38$ and
$f(5)=167$.
Two of the pythagorean lattice grid quadrilaterals with $r=\sqrt 5$

Problem 724
===========

A depot uses $n$ drones to disperse packages containing essential
supplies along a long straight road.
Initially all drones are stationary, loaded with a supply package.
Every second, the depot selects a drone at random and sends it this
instruction:

-   If you are stationary, start moving at one centimetre per second
    along the road.
-   If you are moving, increase your speed by one centimetre per second
    along the road without changing direction.

The road is wide enough that drones can overtake one another without
risk of collision.

Eventually, there will only be one drone left at the depot waiting to
receive its first instruction. As soon as that drone has flown one
centimetre along the road, all drones drop their packages and return to
the depot.

Let $E(n)$ be the expected distance in centimetres from the depot that
the supply packages land.
For example, $E(2) = \frac{7}{2}$, $E(5) = \frac{12019}{720}$, and
$E(100) \approx 1427.193470$.

Find $E(10^8)$. Give your answer rounded to the nearest integer.

Problem 725

A number where one digit is the sum of the **other** digits is called a
[digit sum number]{.dfn} or DS-number for short. For example, $352$,
$3003$ and $32812$ are DS-numbers.

We define $S(n)$ to be the sum of all DS-numbers of $n$ digits or
less.

Problem 726

Consider a stack of bottles of wine. There are $n$ layers in the stack
with the top layer containing only one bottle and the bottom layer
containing $n$ bottles. For $n=4$ the stack looks like the picture
below.

::: {.center}
![](resources/images/0726_FallingBottles.jpg?1678992055){.dark_img}
:::

The [collapsing process]{.dfn} happens every time a bottle is taken. A
space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the
following recursive steps:

-   No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking
    $F$.
-   One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the
    space creating another space. For example, taking $D$.
-   Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the
    space creating another space. For example, taking $C$.

This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle $A$ in
the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either $B$ or $C$.
If it is filled with $C$ then the space that $C$ creates can be
filled with $D$ or $E$. So there are 3 different collapsing
processes that can happen if $A$ is taken, although the final shape
(in this case) is the same.

Define $f(n)$ to be the number of ways that we can take all the
bottles from a stack with $n$ layers. Two ways are considered
different if at any step we took a different bottle or the collapsing
process went differently.

You are given $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 6$ and $f(3) = 1008$.

that is mutually and externally tangent to all the three blue circles.
Let $d=\vert DE \vert$ be the distance between the centres of the
circumcircle and the incircle.

Let $\mathbb{E}(d)$ be the expected value of $d$ when $r\_a$,
$r\_b$ and $r\_c$ are integers chosen uniformly such that $1\leq
r\_a\<r\_b\<r\_c \leq 100$ and $\text{gcd}(r\_a,r\_b,r\_c)=1$.

Consider $n$ coins arranged in a circle where each coin shows heads or
tails. A move consists of turning over $k$ consecutive coins:
tail-head or head-tail. Using a sequence of these moves the objective is

===========

Consider the sequence of real numbers $a\_n$ defined by the starting
value $a\_0$ and the recurrence $\displaystyle a\_{n+1}=a\_n-\frac
1 {a\_n}$ for any $n \ge 0$.

For some starting values $a\_0$ the sequence will be periodic. For
example, $a\_0=\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$ yields the sequence:
$\sqrt{\frac 1 2},-\sqrt{\frac 1 2},\sqrt{\frac 1 2}, \dots$

We are interested in the range of such a periodic sequence which is the
difference between the maximum and minimum of the sequence. For example,
the range of the sequence above would be $\sqrt{\frac 1
2}-(-\sqrt{\frac 1 2})=\sqrt{ 2}$.

Let $S(P)$ be the sum of the ranges of all such periodic sequences
with a period not exceeding $P$.
For example, $S(2)=2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.8284$, being the sum of the
ranges of the two sequences starting with $a\_0=\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$
and $a\_0=-\sqrt{\frac 1 2}$.

is characterized by:

-   the distance from his feet to his shoulders in cm, $h\_n$
-   the length of his arms in cm, $l\_n$
-   his IQ (Irascibility Quotient), $q\_n$.

Trolls can pile up on top of each other, with each troll standing on the
shoulders of the one below him. A troll can climb out of the hole and
escape if his hands can reach to the surface. Once a troll escapes he
cannot participate any further in the escaping effort.

The **logical-OR** of two bits is $0$ if both bits are $0$,
otherwise it is $1$.
The **bitwise-OR** of two positive integers performs a logical-OR
operation on each pair of corresponding bits in the binary expansion of
its inputs.

For example, the bitwise-OR of $10$ and $6$ is $14$ because $10 =

Problem 736
===========

Define two functions on lattice points:

$r(x,y) = (x+1,2y)$

$s(x,y) = (2x,y+1)$

A *path to equality* of length $n$ for a pair $(a,b)$ is a sequence
$\Big((a\_1,b\_1),(a\_2,b\_2),\ldots,(a\_n,b\_n)\Big)$, where:

-   $(a\_1,b\_1) = (a,b)$
-   $(a\_k,b\_k) = r(a\_{k-1},b\_{k-1})$ or $(a\_k,b\_k) =
    s(a\_{k-1},b\_{k-1})$ for $k \> 1$
-   $a\_k \ne b\_k$ for $k \< n$
-   $a\_n = b\_n$

$a\_n = b\_n$ is called the *final value*.

For example,

$(45,90)\xrightarrow{r}
(46,180)\xrightarrow{s}(92,181)\xrightarrow{s}(184,182)\xrightarrow{s}(368,183)\xrightarrow{s}(736,184)\xrightarrow{r}$

$(737,368)\xrightarrow{s}(1474,369)\xrightarrow{r}(1475,738)\xrightarrow{r}(1476,1476)$

This is a path to equality for $(45,90)$ and is of length 10 with
final value 1476. There is no path to equality of $(45,90)$ with
smaller length.

Find the unique path to equality for $(45,90)$ with smallest **odd**
length. Enter the final value as your answer.

Problem 737
===========

A game is played with many identical, round coins on a flat table.

Consider a line perpendicular to the table.
The first coin is placed on the table touching the line.
Then, one by one, the coins are placed horizontally on top of the
previous coin and touching the line.
The complete stack of coins must be balanced after every placement.

The diagram below \[not to scale\] shows a possible placement of 8 coins
where point $P$ represents the line.

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![](project/images/p737_coinloop.jpg){.dark_img}
:::

It is found that a minimum of $31$ coins are needed to form a *coin
loop* around the line, i.e. if in the projection of the coins on the
table the centre of the $n$th coin is rotated $\theta\_n$, about
the line, from the centre of the $(n-1)$th coin then the sum of
$\displaystyle\sum\_{k=2}^n \theta\_k$ is first larger than
$360^\circ$ when $n=31$. In general, to loop $k$ times, $n$ is
the smallest number for which the sum is greater than $360^\circ k$.

Also, $154$ coins are needed to loop two times around the line, and
$6947$ coins to loop ten times.

Calculate the number of coins needed to loop $2020$ times around the
line.

Problem 739
===========

Take a sequence of length $n$. Discard the first term then make a
sequence of the partial summations. Continue to do this over and over
until we are left with a single term. We define this to be $f(n)$.

Consider the example where we start with a sequence of length 8:

$ \begin{array}{rrrrrrrr} 1&1&1&1&1&1&1&1\\ &1&2&3&4&5& 6 &7\\ &
&2&5&9&14&20&27\\ & & &5&14&28&48&75\\ & & & &14&42&90&165\\ & & &
& & 42 & 132 & 297\\ & & & & & & 132 &429\\ & & & & & & &429\
\end{array} $

Then the final number is $429$, so $f(8) = 429$.

For this problem we start with the sequence
$1,3,4,7,11,18,29,47,\ldots$
This is the Lucas sequence where two terms are added to get the next
term.
Applying the same process as above we get $f(8) = 2663$.
You are also given $f(20) = 742296999 $ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$

Problem 740

Secret Santa is a process that allows $n$ people to give each other
presents, so that each person gives a single present and receives a
single present. At the beginning each of the $n$ people write their
name on a slip of paper and put the slip into a hat. Each person takes a
random slip from the hat. If the slip has their name they draw another
random slip from the hat and then put the slip with their name back into
the hat. At the end everyone buys a Christmas present for the person
whose name is on the slip they are holding. This process will fail if
the last person draws their own name.

In this variation each of the $n$ people gives and receives two
presents. At the beginning each of the $n$ people writes their name on
two slips of paper and puts the slips into a hat (there will be $2n$
slips of paper in the hat). As before each person takes from the hat a
random slip that does not contain their own name. Then the same person
repeats this process thus ending up with two slips, neither of which
contains that person\'s own name. Then the next person draws two slips
in the same way, and so on. The process will fail if the last person
gets at least one slip with their own name.

\"What? Where? When?\" is a TV game show in which a team of experts
attempt to answer questions. The following is a simplified version of
the game.

Upside Down is a modification of the famous Pythagorean equation:

\end{align}

A solution $(x,y,z)$ to this equation with $x,y$ and $z$ positive

For $N=100$ the primitive solutions are $(2,3,6)$ and $(5,90,18)$,

Problem 750
===========

Card Stacking is a game on a computer starting with an array of $N$
cards labelled $1,2,\ldots,N$. A stack of cards can be moved by
dragging horizontally with the mouse to another stack but only when the
resulting stack is in sequence. The goal of the game is to combine the
cards into a single stack using minimal total drag distance.

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![](project/images/p750_optimal_card_stacking.png){.dark_img}

For the given arrangement of 6 cards the minimum total distance is $1 +
3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8$.

For $N$ cards, the cards are arranged so that the card at position
$n$ is $3^n\bmod(N+1), 1\le n\le N$.

We define $G(N)$ to be the minimal total drag distance to arrange
these cards into a single sequence.
For example, when $N = 6$ we get the sequence $3,2,6,4,5,1$ and
$G(6) = 8$.
You are given $G(16) = 47$.

Problem 751
===========

A non-decreasing sequence of integers $a\_n$ can be generated from any
positive real value $\theta$ by the following procedure:
\begin{align} \begin{split} b\_1 &= \theta \\ b\_n &=
\left\lfloor b\_{n-1} \right\rfloor \left(b\_{n-1} - \left\lfloor
b\_{n-1} \right\rfloor + 1\right)\~\~\~\forall \~ n \geq 2 \
a\_n &= \left\lfloor b\_{n} \right\rfloor \end{split} \end{align}
Where $\left\lfloor \cdot \right\rfloor$ is the floor function.

For example, $\theta=2.956938891377988\...$ generates the Fibonacci
sequence: $2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \...$

The *concatenation* of a sequence of positive integers $a\_n$ is a
real value denoted $\tau$ constructed by concatenating the elements
of the sequence after the decimal point, starting at $a\_1$:
$a\_1.a\_2a\_3a\_4\...$

For example, the Fibonacci sequence constructed from
$\theta=2.956938891377988\...$ yields the concatenation
$\tau=2.3581321345589\...$ Clearly, $\tau \neq \theta$ for this
value of $\theta$.

Find the only value of $\theta$ for which the generated sequence
starts at $a\_1=2$ and the concatenation of the generated sequence
equals the original value: $\tau = \theta$. Give your answer rounded
to $24$ places after the decimal point.

Problem 752
===========

When $(1+\sqrt 7)$ is raised to an integral power, $n$, we always
get a number of the form $(a+b\sqrt 7)$.
We write $(1+\sqrt 7)^n = \alpha(n) + \beta(n)\sqrt 7$.

integer $n$ such that: $$\begin{align} \alpha(n) &\equiv 1 \pmod
x\qquad \text{and }\\ \beta(n) &\equiv 0 \pmod x\end{align} $$
and $g(x) = 0$ if there is no such value of $n$. For example, $g(3)
= 0$, $g(5) = 12$.

Further define $$ G(N) = \sum\_{x=2}^N g(x)$$ You are given
$G(10^2) = 28891$ and $G(10^3) = 13131583$.

Fermat\'s Last Theorem states that no three positive integers $a$,
$b$, $c$ satisfy the equation $$a^n+b^n=c^n$$ for any integer

For this problem we are only considering the case $n=3$. For certain
values of $p$, it is possible to solve the congruence equation:
$$a^3+b^3 \equiv c^3 \pmod{p}$$

For a prime $p$, we define $F(p)$ as the number of integer solutions
to this equation for $1 \le a,b,c \< p$.

Problem 755
===========

Consider the Fibonacci sequence $\{1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots\}$.

We let $f(n)$ be the number of ways of representing an integer $n\ge
0$ as the sum of different Fibonacci numbers.
For example, $16 = 3+13 = 1+2+13 = 3+5+8 = 1+2+5+8$ and hence $f(16)
= 4$. By convention $f(0) = 1$.

Further we define $$S(n) = \sum\_{k=0}^n f(k).$$ You are given
$S(100) = 415$ and $S(10^4) = 312807$.

Find $\displaystyle S(10^{13})$.

Problem 756
===========

Consider a function $f(k)$ defined for all positive integers $k\>0$.
Let $S$ be the sum of the first $n$ values of $f$. That is,
$$S=f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+\cdots+f(n)=\sum\_{k=1}^n f(k).$$

In this problem, we employ randomness to approximate this sum. That is,
we choose a random, uniformly distributed, $m$-tuple of positive
integers $(X\_1,X\_2,X\_3,\cdots,X\_m)$ such that $0=X\_0 \lt X\_1
\lt X\_2 \lt \cdots \lt X\_m \leq n$ and calculate a modified sum
$S^\*$ as follows. $$S^\* = \sum\_{i=1}^m
f(X\_i)(X\_i-X\_{i-1})$$

We now define the error of this approximation to be $\Delta=S-S^\*$.

Let $\mathbb{E}(\Delta\|f(k),n,m)$ be the expected value of the
error given the function $f(k)$, the number of terms $n$ in the sum
and the length of random sample $m$.

For example, $\mathbb{E}(\Delta\|k,100,50) = 2525/1326 \approx
1.904223$ and $\mathbb{E}(\Delta\|\varphi(k),10^4,10^2)\approx
5842.849907$, where $\varphi(k)$ is Euler\'s totient function.

There are 3 buckets labelled $S$ (small) of 3 litres, $M$ (medium)
of 5 litres and $L$ (large) of 8 litres.
Initially $S$ and $M$ are full of water and $L$ is empty. By
pouring water between the buckets exactly one litre of water can be
measured.
Since there is no other way to measure, once a pouring starts it cannot
stop until either the source bucket is empty or the destination bucket
is full.
At least four pourings are needed to get one litre:

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
$(3,5,0)\xrightarrow{M\to L} (3,0,5) \xrightarrow{S\to M} (0,3,5)
\xrightarrow{L\to S}(3,3,2) \xrightarrow{S\to M}(1,5,2)$
:::

After these operations, there is exactly one litre in bucket $S$.

In general the sizes of the buckets $S, M, L$ are $a$, $b$, $a +
b$ litres, respectively. Initially $S$ and $M$ are full and $L$
is empty. If the above rule of pouring still applies and $a$ and $b$
are two coprime positive integers with $a\leq b$ then it is always
possible to measure one litre in finitely many steps.

Let $P(a,b)$ be the minimal number of pourings needed to get one
litre. Thus $P(3,5)=4$.
Also, $P(7, 31)=20$ and $P(1234, 4321)=2780$.

Find the sum of $P(2^{p^5}-1, 2^{q^5}-1)$ for all pairs of prime

Problem 761
===========

Two friends, a runner and a swimmer, are playing a sporting game: The
swimmer is swimming within a circular pool while the runner moves along
the pool edge. While the runner tries to catch the swimmer at the very
moment that the swimmer leaves the pool, the swimmer tries to reach the
edge before the runner arrives there. They start the game with the
swimmer located in the middle of the pool, while the runner is located
anywhere at the edge of the pool.

We assume that the swimmer can move with any velocity up to $1$ in any
direction and the runner can move with any velocity up to $v$ in
either direction around the edge of the pool. Moreover we assume that
both players can react immediately to any change of movement of their
opponent.

Assuming optimal strategy of both players, it can be shown that the
swimmer can always win by escaping the pool at some point at the edge
before the runner gets there, if $v$ is less than the critical speed
$V\_{Circle} \approx 4.60333885$ and can never win if
$v\>V\_{Circle}$.

Now the two players play the game in a perfectly square pool. Again the
swimmer starts in the middle of the pool, while the runner starts at the
midpoint of one of the edges of the pool. It can be shown that the
critical maximal speed of the runner below which the swimmer can always
escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer when
trying to leave the pool is $V\_{Square} \approx 5.78859314$.

At last, both players decide to play the game in a pool in the form of
regular hexagon. Giving the same conditions as above, with the swimmer
starting in the middle of the pool and the runner at the midpoint of one
of the edges of the pool, find the critical maximal speed
$V\_{Hexagon}$ of the runner, below which the swimmer can always
escape and above which the runner can always catch the swimmer. Give
your answer rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point.

y, z)$, $(x, y + 1, z)$ and $(x, y, z + 1)$, provided these cubes
are empty.

Originally there is only one amoeba in the cube $(0, 0, 0)$. After
$N$ divisions there will be $2N+1$ amoebas arranged in the grid. An
arrangement may be reached in several different ways but it is only
counted once. Let $D(N)$ be the number of different possible
arrangements after $N$ divisions.

For example, $D(2) = 3$, $D(10) = 44499$, $D(20)=9204559704$ and
the last nine digits of $D(100)$ are $780166455$.

Consider the following Diophantine equation: $$16x^2+y^4=z^2$$
where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are positive integers.

Let $S(N) = \displaystyle{\sum(x+y+z)}$ where the sum is over all
solutions $(x,y,z)$ such that $1 \leq x,y,z \leq N$ and
$\gcd(x,y,z)=1$.

For $N=100$, there are only two such solutions: $(3,4,20)$ and
$(10,3,41)$. So $S(10^2)=81$.

Starting with 1 gram of gold you play a game. Each round you bet a
certain amount of your gold: if you have $x$ grams you can bet $b$
grams for any $0 \le b \le x$. You then toss an unfair coin: with a
probability of $0.6$ you double your bet (so you now have $x+b$),
otherwise you lose your bet (so you now have $x-b$).

Choosing your bets to maximize your probability of having at least a
trillion $(10^{12})$ grams of gold after $1000$ rounds, what is the
probability that you become a trillionaire?

All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your

A **sliding block puzzle** is a puzzle where pieces are confined to a
grid and by sliding the pieces a final configuration is reached. In this
problem the pieces can only be slid in multiples of one unit in the
directions up, down, left, right.

A [reachable configuration]{.dfn} is any arrangement of the pieces that
can be achieved by sliding the pieces from the initial configuration.

Two configurations are identical if the same shape pieces occupy the
same position in the grid. So in the case below the red squares are
indistinguishable. For this example the number of reachable
configurations is $208$.

A certain type of chandelier contains a circular ring of $n$ evenly
spaced candleholders.
If only one candle is fitted, then the chandelier will be imbalanced.
However, if a second identical candle is placed in the opposite
candleholder (assuming $n$ is even) then perfect balance will be
achieved and the chandelier will hang level.

Let $f(n,m)$ be the number of ways of arranging $m$ identical
candles in distinct sockets of a chandelier with $n$ candleholders
such that the chandelier is perfectly balanced.

For example, $f(4, 2) = 2$: assuming the chandelier\'s four
candleholders are aligned with the compass points, the two valid
arrangements are \"North & South\" and \"East & West\". Note that these
are considered to be different arrangements even though they are related

A $k$-bounded partition of a positive integer $N$ is a way of
writing $N$ as a sum of positive integers not exceeding $k$.

A balanceable partition is a partition that can be further divided into
two parts of equal sums.

For example, $3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1$ is a balanceable $3$-bounded
partition of $12$ since $3 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 2$. Conversely, $3 + 3
+ 3 + 1$ is a $3$-bounded partition of $10$ which is not
balanceable.

Let $f(k)$ be the smallest positive integer $N$ all of whose
$k$-bounded partitions are balanceable. For example, $f(3) = 12$ and

leaving a void.

With 10 cubes, the arrangement illustrated above is optimal, so
$g(10)=60-30=30$. With 18 cubes, it can be shown that the optimal

piles.

Note that the game is only playable if the sizes of the two piles are
coprime.

A game state $(a, b)$ is a winning position if the next player can
guarantee a win with optimal play. Define $H(N)$ to be the number of
winning positions $(a, b)$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, $a \> 0$, $b \>

Given an odd prime $p$, put the numbers $1,\...,p-1$ into
$\frac{p-1}{2}$ pairs such that each number appears exactly once.
Each pair $(a,b)$ has a cost of $ab \bmod p$. For example, if
$p=5$ the pair $(3,4)$ has a cost of $12 \bmod 5 = 2$.

The *total cost* of a pairing is the sum of the costs of its pairs. We
say that such pairing is optimal if its total cost is minimal for that
$p$.

For example, if $p = 5$, then there is a unique optimal pairing: $(1,
2), (3, 4)$, with total cost of $2 + 2 = 4$.

The [cost product]{.dfn} of a pairing is the product of the costs of its
pairs. For example, the cost product of the optimal pairing for $p =
5$ is $2 \cdot 2 = 4$.

It turns out that all optimal pairings for $p = 2\,000\,000\,011$

For example, if $N\_t = (3,9,47,20)$, the range would be $3\le x\le
9$ and $20\le y\le47$, and would include 196 clocks.

For each $t$ $(t\>0)$, the clocks within the range represented by

Denote the average of $k$ numbers $x\_1, \..., x\_k$ by $\bar{x} =
\frac{1}{k} \sum\_i x\_i$. Their variance is defined as

A standard $52$ card deck comprises thirteen ranks in four suits.
However, modern decks have two additional Jokers, which neither have a
suit nor a rank, for a total of $54$ cards. If we shuffle such a deck
and draw cards without replacement, then we would need, on average,
approximately $29.05361725$ cards so that we have at least one card
for each rank.

Now, assume you have $10$ such decks, each with a different back
design. We shuffle all $10 \times 54$ cards together and draw cards
without replacement. What is the expected number of cards needed so
every suit, rank and deck design have at least one card?

A **monic polynomial** is a single-variable polynomial in which the
coefficient of highest degree is equal to $1$.

Define $\mathcal{F}$ to be the set of all monic polynomials with
integer coefficients (including the constant polynomial $p(x)=1$). A
polynomial $p(x)\in\mathcal{F}$ is [cyclogenic]{.dfn} if there
exists $q(x)\in\mathcal{F}$ and a positive integer $n$ such that
$p(x)q(x)=x^n-1$. If $n$ is the smallest such positive integer then
$p(x)$ is [$n$-cyclogenic]{.dfn}.

Define $P\_n(x)$ to be the sum of all $n$-cyclogenic polynomials.
For example, there exist ten 6-cyclogenic polynomials (which divide
$x^6-1$ and no smaller $x^k-1$):

Problem 798
===========

Two players play a game with a deck of cards which contains $s$ suits
with each suit containing $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$.

Before the game starts, a set of cards (which may be empty) is picked
from the deck and placed face-up on the table, with no overlap. These
are called the visible cards.

The players then make moves in turn.
A move consists of choosing a card X from the rest of the deck and
placing it face-up on top of a visible card Y, subject to the following
restrictions:

-   X and Y must be the same suit;
-   the value of X must be larger than the value of Y.

The card X then covers the card Y and replaces Y as a visible card.
The player unable to make a valid move loses and play stops.

Let $C(n, s)$ be the number of different initial sets of cards for
which the first player will lose given best play for both players.

For example, $C(3, 2) = 26$ and $C(13, 4) \equiv 540318329 \pmod
{1\,000\,000\,007}$.

Find $C(10^7, 10^7)$. Give your answer modulo

of two pentagonal numbers in two different ways

$$ \begin{align} P\_{49} = 3577 & = 3432 + 145 = P\_{48} + P\_{10}
\\ & = 3290 + 287 = P\_{47}+P\_{14} \end{align} $$

Let $\Bbb R^2$ be the set of pairs of real numbers $(x, y)$. Let
$\pi = 3.14159\cdots\ $.

Consider the function $f$ from $\Bbb R^2$ to $\Bbb R^2$
defined by $f(x, y) = (x^2 - x - y^2, 2xy - y + \pi)$, and its
$n$-th iterated composition $f^{(n)}(x, y) = f(f(\cdots f(x,

**Rand48** is a pseudorandom number generator used by some programming
languages. It generates a sequence from any given integer $0 \le a\_0
\< 2^{48}$ using the rule $a\_n = (25214903917 \cdot a\_{n - 1} +
11) \bmod 2^{48}$.

Let $b\_n = \lfloor a\_n / 2^{16} \rfloor \bmod 52$. The sequence
$b\_0, b\_1, \dots$ is translated to an infinite string $c =

$0 \rightarrow$ a, $1\rightarrow$ b, $\dots$, $25
\rightarrow$ z, $26 \rightarrow$ A, $27 \rightarrow$ B,
$\dots$, $51 \rightarrow$ Z.

For example, if we choose $a\_0 = 123456$, then the string $c$
starts with: \"bQYicNGCY$\dots$\".
Moreover, starting from index $100$, we encounter the substring
\"RxqLBfWzv\" for the first time.

For a positive rational number $r$, we define $N(r)$ as the smallest
positive integer $n$ such that $s(n)=r\cdot n$.
If no such integer exists, then $N(r)$ is defined as zero.
For example, $N(3)=142857$, $N(\tfrac 1{10})=10$ and $N(2) = 0$.

Let $T(M)$ be the sum of $N(u^3/v^3)$ where $(u,v)$ ranges over
all ordered pairs of coprime positive integers not exceeding $M$.
For example, $T(3)\equiv 262429173 \pmod {1\,000\,000\,007}$.

This problem combines the game of Nim with the Towers of Hanoi. For a
brief introduction to the rules of these games, please refer to [Problem
301](problem=301) and [Problem 497](problem=497), respectively.

The unique shortest solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem with $n$
disks and $3$ pegs requires $2^n-1$ moves. Number the positions in
the solution from index 0 (starting position, all disks on the first
peg) to index $2^n-1$ (final position, all disks on the third peg).

Each of these $2^n$ positions can be considered as the starting
configuration for a game of Nim, in which two players take turns to
select a peg and remove any positive number of disks from it. The winner
is the player who removes the last disk.

We define $f(n)$ to be the sum of the indices of those positions for
which, when considered as a Nim game, the first player will lose
(assuming an optimal strategy from both players).

For $n=4$, the indices of losing positions in the shortest solution
are 3,6,9 and 12. So we have $f(4) = 30$.

You are given that $f(10) = 67518$.

Given a circle $C$ and an integer $n \> 1$, we perform the following
operations.

In step $0$, we choose two uniformly random points $R\_0$ and
$B\_0$ on $C$.
In step $i$ ($1 \leq i \< n$), we first choose a uniformly random
point $R\_i$ on $C$ and connect the points $R\_{i - 1}$ and
$R\_i$ with a red rope; then choose a uniformly random point $B\_i$
on $C$ and connect the points $B\_{i - 1}$ and $B\_i$ with a blue
rope.
In step $n$, we first connect the points $R\_{n - 1}$ and $R\_0$
with a red rope; then connect the points $B\_{n - 1}$ and $B\_0$
with a blue rope.
Each rope is straight between its two end points, and lies above all
previous ropes.

After step $n$, we get a loop of red ropes, and a loop of blue ropes.
Sometimes the two loops can be separated, as in the left figure below;
sometimes they are \"linked\", hence cannot be separated, as in the
middle and right figures below.

::: {style="text-align:center;"}

Let $P(n)$ be the probability that the two loops can be separated.

0.4304177690$.

Find $P(80)$, rounded to $10$ digits after decimal point.

Define the [XOR-product]{.dfn} of $x$ and $y$, denoted by $x
\otimes y$, similar to a long multiplication in base $2$, except
that the intermediate results are XORed instead of the usual integer
addition.

For example, $7 \otimes 3 = 9$, or in base $2$, $111\_2 \otimes
11\_2 = 1001\_2$:

An [XOR-prime]{.dfn} is an integer $n$ greater than $1$ that is not
an XOR-product of two integers greater than $1$. The above example
shows that $9$ is not an XOR-prime. Similarly, $5 = 3 \otimes 3$ is

Let $S(n)$ be the number of dynamical polynomials of degree $n$.
For example, $S(2)=6$, as there are six dynamical polynomials of

    \mathopen{}\left( \frac 1 5 \right)\mathclose{} = 0$
-   $d\_7 \mathopen{}\left( \frac 1 3 \right)\mathclose{} = 3$

Problem 821
===========

A set, $S$, of integers is called [123-separable]{.dfn} if $S$,
$2S$ and $3S$ are disjoint. Here $2S$ and $3S$ are obtained by
multiplying all the elements in $S$ by $2$ and $3$ respectively.

Define $F(n)$ to be the maximum number of elements of $$(S\cup 2S
\cup 3S)\cap \{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$$ where $S$ ranges over all

Problem 822
===========

A list initially contains the numbers $2, 3, \dots, n$.
At each round, the smallest number in the list is replaced by its
square. If there is more than one such number, then only one of them is
replaced.

For example, below are the first three rounds for $n = 5$: $$\[2, 3,
4, 5\] \xrightarrow{(1)} \[4, 3, 4, 5\] \xrightarrow{(2)} \[4, 9, 4,
5\] \xrightarrow{(3)} \[16, 9, 4, 5\].$$

Let $S(n, m)$ be the sum of all numbers in the list after $m$
rounds.

For example, $S(5, 3) = 16 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 34$. Also $S(10, 100)
\equiv 845339386 \pmod{1234567891}$.

Problem 823
===========

A list initially contains the numbers $2, 3, \dots, n$.
At each round, every number in the list is divided by its smallest prime
factor. Then the product of these smallest prime factors is added to the
list as a new number. Finally, all numbers that become $1$ are removed
from the list.

For example, below are the first three rounds for $n = 5$: $$\[2, 3,
4, 5\] \xrightarrow{(1)} \[2, 60\] \xrightarrow{(2)} \[30, 4\]
\xrightarrow{(3)} \[15, 2, 4\].$$ Let $S(n, m)$ be the sum of all
numbers in the list after $m$ rounds.
For example, $S(5, 3) = 15 + 2 + 4 = 21$. Also $S(10, 100) = 257$.

Problem 824
===========

A [Slider]{.dfn} is a chess piece that can move one square left or
right.

This problem uses a cylindrical chess board where the left hand edge of
the board is connected to the right hand edge. This means that a Slider
that is on the left hand edge of the chess board can move to the right
hand edge of the same row and vice versa.

Let $L(N,K)$ be the number of ways $K$ non-attacking Sliders can be
placed on an $N \times N$ cylindrical chess-board.

For example, $L(2,2)=4$ and $L(6,12)=4204761$.

Find $L(10^9,10^{15}) \bmod \left(10^7+19\right)^2$.

Problem 825
===========

Two cars are on a circular track of total length $2n$, facing the same
direction, initially distance $n$ apart.
They move in turn. At each turn, the moving car will advance a distance
of $1$, $2$ or $3$, with equal probabilities.
The chase ends when the moving car reaches or goes beyond the position
of the other car. The moving car is declared the winner.

Let $S(n)$ be the difference between the winning probabilities of the
two cars.
For example, when $n = 2$, the winning probabilities of the two cars
are $\frac 9 {11}$ and $\frac 2 {11}$, and thus $S(2) = \frac 7
{11}$.

Let $\displaystyle T(N) = \sum\_{n = 2}^N S(n)$.

You are given that $T(10) = 2.38235282$ rounded to 8 digits after the

decimal point.

Problem 827
===========

Define $Q(n)$ to be the smallest number that occurs in exactly $n$
**Pythagorean triples** $(a,b,c)$ where $a \lt b \lt c$.

For example, $15$ is the smallest number occurring in exactly $5$
Pythagorean triples: $$(9,12,\mathbf{15})\quad
(8,\mathbf{15},17)\quad (\mathbf{15},20,25)\quad
(\mathbf{15},36,39)\quad (\mathbf{15},112,113)$$ and so $Q(5) =
15$.

You are also given $Q(10)=48$ and $Q(10^3)=8064000$.

Find $\displaystyle \sum\_{k=1}^{18} Q(10^k)$. Give your answer
modulo $409120391$.

Problem 828
===========

It is a common recreational problem to make a target number using a
selection of other numbers. In this problem you will be given six
numbers and a target number.

For example, given the six numbers $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $7$,
$25$, and a target of $211$, one possible solution is:

$$211 = (3+6)\times 25 − (4\times7)\div 2$$

This uses all six numbers. However, it is not necessary to do so.
Another solution that does not use the $7$ is:

$$211 = (25−2)\times (6+3) + 4$$

Define the *score* of a solution to be the sum of the numbers used. In
the above example problem, the two given solutions have scores $47$
and $40$ respectively. It turns out that this problem has no solutions
with score less than $40$.

When combining numbers, the following rules must be observed:

-   Each available number may be used at most once.
-   Only the four basic arithmetic operations are permitted: $+$,
    $-$, $\times$, $\div$.
-   All intermediate values must be positive integers, so for example
    $(3\div 2)$ is never permitted as a subexpression (even if the
    final answer is an integer).

The attached file
[number-challenges.txt](project/resources/p828_number_challenges.txt)
contains 200 problems, one per line in the format:

`211:2,3,4,6,7,25`

where the number before the colon is the target and the remaining
comma-separated numbers are those available to be used.

Numbering the problems 1, 2, \..., 200, we let $s\_n$ be the minimum
score of the solution to the $n$th problem. For example, $s\_1=40$,
as the first problem in the file is the example given above. Note that
not all problems have a solution; in such cases we take $s\_n=0$.

Find $\displaystyle\sum\_{n=1}^{200} 3^n s\_n$. Give your answer
modulo $1005075251$.

Problem 829
===========

Given any integer $n \gt 1$ a [binary factor tree]{.dfn} $T(n)$ is
defined to be:

-   A tree with the single node $n$ when $n$ is prime.
-   A binary tree that has root node $n$, left subtree $T(a)$ and
    right subtree $T(b)$, when $n$ is not prime. Here $a$ and
    $b$ are positive integers such that $n = ab$, $a\le b$ and
    $b-a$ is the smallest.

For example $T(20)$:

![0829\_example1.jpg](resources/images/0829_example1.jpg?1678992055)

We define $M(n)$ to be the smallest number that has a factor tree
identical in shape to the factor tree for $n!!$, the **double
factorial** of $n$.

For example, consider $9!! = 9\times 7\times 5\times 3\times 1 =
945$. The factor tree for $945$ is shown below together with the
factor tree for $72$ which is the smallest number that has a factor
tree of the same shape. Hence $M(9) = 72$.

Problem 833
===========

Triangle numbers $T\_k$ are integers of the form $\frac{k(k+1)}
2$.
A few triangle numbers happen to be perfect squares like $T\_1=1$ and
$T\_8=36$, but more can be found when considering the product of two
triangle numbers. For example, $T\_2 \cdot T\_{24}=3 \cdot
300=30^2$.

Let $S(n)$ be the sum of $c$ for all integers triples $(a, b, c)$
with $0\<c \le n$, $c^2=T\_a \cdot T\_b$ and $0\<a\<b$. For
example, $S(100)= \sqrt{T\_1 T\_8}+\sqrt{T\_2 T\_{24}}+\sqrt{T\_1
T\_{49}}+\sqrt{T\_3 T\_{48}}=6+30+35+84=155$.

A sequence is created by starting with a positive integer $n$ and
incrementing by $(n+m)$ at the $m^{th}$ step. If $n=10$, the

Problem 837
===========

[Amidakuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidakuji) (Japanese:
阿弥陀籤) is a method for producing a random permutation of a set of
objects.

In the beginning, a number of parallel vertical lines are drawn, one for
each object. Then a specified number of horizontal rungs are added, each
lower than any previous rungs. Each rung is drawn as a line segment
spanning a randomly select pair of adjacent vertical lines.

For example, the following diagram depicts an Amidakuji with three
objects ($A$, $B$, $C$) and six rungs:

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![0837\_amidakuji.png](resources/images/0837_amidakuji.png?1678992054)
:::

The coloured lines in the diagram illustrate how to form the
permutation. For each object, starting from the top of its vertical
line, trace downwards but follow any rung encountered along the way, and
record which vertical we end up on. In this example, the resulting
permutation happens to be the identity: $A\mapsto A$, $B\mapsto
B$, $C\mapsto C$.

Let $a(m, n)$ be the number of different three-object Amidakujis that
have $m$ rungs between $A$ and $B$, and $n$ rungs between $B$
and $C$, and whose outcome is the identity permutation. For example,
$a(3, 3) = 2$, because the Amidakuji shown above and its mirror image
are the only ones with the required property.

You are also given that $a(123, 321) \equiv 172633303
\pmod{1234567891}$.

Problem 838

Let $f(N)$ be the smallest positive integer that is not coprime to any
positive integer $n \le N$ whose least significant digit is $3$.

For example $f(40)$ equals to $897 = 3 \cdot 13 \cdot 23$ since it
is not coprime to any of $3,13,23,33$. By taking the **[natural
logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm)** (log to
base $e$) we obtain $\ln f(40) = \ln 897 \approx 6.799056$ when
rounded to six digits after the decimal point.

You are also given $\ln f(2800) \approx 715.019337$.

The sequence $S\_n$ is defined by $S\_0 = 290797$ and $S\_n = S\_{n

There are $N$ bowls indexed $0,1,\dots ,N-1$. Initially there are
$S\_n$ beans in bowl $n$.

At each step, the smallest index $n$ is found such that bowl $n$ has
strictly more beans than bowl $n+1$. Then one bean is moved from bowl
$n$ to bowl $n+1$.

Let $B(N)$ be the number of steps needed to sort the bowls into
non-descending order.
For example, $B(5) = 0$, $B(6) = 14263289$ and
$B(100)=3284417556$.

Find $B(10^7)$.

Problem 840
===========

A **partition** of $n$ is a set of positive integers for which the sum
equals $n$.
The partitions of 5 are:
$\{5\},\{1,4\},\{2,3\},\{1,1,3\},\{1,2,2\},\{1,1,1,2\}$
and $\{1,1,1,1,1\}$.

Further we define the function $D(p)$ as:
$$ \begin{align} \begin{split} D(1) &= 1 \\ D(p) &= 1, \text{ for
any prime } p \\ D(pq) &= D(p)q + pD(q), \text{ for any positive
integers } p,q \gt 1. \end{split} \end{align} $$

Now let $\{a\_1, a\_2,\ldots,a\_k\}$ be a partition of $n$.
We assign to this particular partition the value:
$$P=\prod\_{j=1}^{k}D(a\_j). $$

$G(n)$ is the sum of $P$ for all partitions of $n$.
We can verify that $G(10) = 164$.

We also define: $$S(N)=\sum\_{n=1}^{N}G(n).$$ You are given
$S(10)=396$.
Find $S(5\times 10^4) \mod 999676999$.

Problem 841

The regular star polygon $\{p/q\}$, for coprime integers $p,q$
with $p \gt 2q \gt 0$, is a polygon formed from $p$ edges of equal
length and equal internal angles, such that tracing the complete polygon
wraps $q$ times around the centre. For example, $\{8/3\}$ is
illustrated below:

:::

The edges of a regular star polygon intersect one another, dividing the
interior into several regions. Define the [alternating shading]{.dfn} of
a regular star polygon to be a selection of such regions to shade, such
that every piece of every edge has a shaded region on one side and an
unshaded region on the other, with the exterior of the polygon unshaded.
For example, the above image shows the alternating shading (in green) of
$\{8/3\}$.

Let $A(p, q)$ be the area of the alternating shading of $\{p/q\}$,
assuming that its inradius is $1$. (The **inradius** of a regular
polygon, star or otherwise, is the distance from its centre to the
midpoint of any of its edges.) For example, in the diagram above, it can
be shown that central shaded octagon has area $8(\sqrt{2}-1)$ and
each point\'s shaded kite has area $2(\sqrt{2}-1)$, giving $A(8,3) =
24(\sqrt{2}-1) \approx 9.9411254970$.

You are also given that $A(130021, 50008)\approx 10.9210371479$,
rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.

Find $\sum\_{n=3}^{34} A(F\_{n+1},F\_{n-1})$, where $F\_j$ is the

Given $n$ equally spaced points on a circle, we define an [$n$-star
polygon]{.dfn} as an $n$-gon having those $n$ points as vertices.
Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are

For an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self
intersection points.
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.
For the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$
self intersection points.

Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two
lines. These are only counted once. For example,
[$S$,]{style="white-space:nowrap;"} shown below is one of the sixty
$6$-star polygons. This one has $I(S) = 4$.

Problem 843
===========

This problem involves an iterative procedure that begins with a circle
of $n\ge 3$ integers. At each step every number is simultaneously
replaced with the absolute difference of its two neighbours.

For any initial values, the procedure eventually becomes periodic.

Let $S(N)$ be the sum of all possible periods for $3\le n \leq N$.
For example, $S(6) = 6$, because the possible periods for $3\le n
\leq 6$ are $1, 2, 3$. Specifically, $n=3$ and $n=4$ can each
have period $1$ only, while $n=5$ can have period $1$ or $3$,
and $n=6$ can have period $1$ or $2$.

===========

Consider positive integer solutions to

$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 3abc$

For example, $(1,5,13)$ is a solution. We define a 3-Markov number to
be any part of a solution, so $1$, $5$ and $13$ are all 3-Markov
numbers. Adding distinct 3-Markov numbers $\le 10^3$ would give
$2797$.

Now we define a $k$-Markov number to be a positive integer that is
part of a solution to:

$\displaystyle \sum\_{i=1}^{k}x\_i^2=k\prod\_{i=1}^{k}x\_i,\quad
x\_i\text{ are positive integers}$

Let $M\_k(N)$ be the sum of $k$-Markov numbers $\le N$. Hence
$M\_3(10^{3})=2797$, also $M\_8(10^8) = 131493335$.

Problem 847
===========

Jack has three plates in front of him. The giant has $N$ beans that he
distributes to the three plates. All the beans look the same, but one of
them is a magic bean. Jack doesn\'t know which one it is, but the giant
knows.

Jack can ask the giant questions of the form: \"Does this subset of the
beans contain the magic bean?\" In each question Jack may choose any
subset of beans from a single plate, and the giant will respond
truthfully.

If the three plates contain $a$, $b$ and $c$ beans respectively,
we let $h(a, b, c)$ be the minimal number of questions Jack needs to
ask in order to guarantee he locates the magic bean. For example, $h(1,
2, 3) = 3$ and $h(2, 3, 3) = 4$.

non-negative integers $a$, $b$, $c$ with $1 \leq a + b + c \leq
N$.

Two players play a game. At the start of the game each player secretly
chooses an integer; the first player from $1,\...,n$ and the second
player from $1,\...,m$. Then they take alternate turns, starting with
the first player. The player, whose turn it is, displays a set of
numbers and the other player tells whether their secret number is in the
set or not. The player to correctly guess a set with a single number is
the winner and the game ends.

In a tournament there are $n$ teams and each team plays each other
team twice. A team gets two points for a win, one point for a draw and
no points for a loss.

With two teams there are three possible outcomes for the total points.
$(4,0)$ where a team wins twice, $(3,1)$ where a team wins and
draws, and $(2,2)$ where either there are two draws or a team wins one
game and loses the other. Here we do not distinguish the teams and so

Problem 852
===========

This game has a box of $N$ unfair coins and $N$ fair coins. Fair
coins have probability 50% of landing heads while unfair coins have
probability 75% of landing heads.

The player begins with a score of 0 which may become negative during
play.

At each round the player randomly picks a coin from the box and guesses
its type: fair or unfair. Before guessing they may toss the coin any
number of times; however, each toss subtracts 1 from their score. The
decision to stop tossing and make a guess can be made at any time. After
guessing the player\'s score is increased by 20 if they are right and
decreased by 50 if they are wrong. Then the coin type is revealed to the
player and the coin is discarded.

After $2N$ rounds the box will be empty and the game is over. Let
$S(N)$ be the expected score of the player at the end of the game
assuming that they play optimally in order to maximize their expected
score.

You are given $S(1) = 20.558591$ rounded to 6 digits after the decimal

Given two positive integers $a,b$, Alex and Bianca play a game in
$ab$ rounds. They begin with a square piece of paper of side length
$1$.

In each round Alex divides the current rectangular piece of paper into
$a \times b$ pieces using $a-1$ horizontal cuts and $b-1$
vertical ones. The cuts do not need to be evenly spaced. Moreover, a
piece can have zero width/height when a cut coincides with another cut
or the edge of the paper. The pieces are then numbered $1, 2, \...,
ab$ starting from the left top corner, moving from left to right and
starting from the left of the next row when a row is finished.

Then Bianca chooses one of the pieces for the game to continue on.
However, Bianca must not choose a piece with a number she has already
chosen during the game.

Bianca wants to minimize the area of the final piece of paper while Alex
wants to maximize it. Let $S(a,b)$ be the area of the final piece

A standard 52-card deck comprises 13 ranks in four suits. A *pair* is a
set of two cards of the same rank.

Cards are drawn, without replacement, from a well shuffled 52-card deck
waiting for consecutive cards that form a pair. For example, the

distinct vertices there must be exactly one of the following:

Such a graph is called *beautiful* if

===========

Odd and Even are playing a game with $N$ cookies.

The game begins with the $N$ cookies divided into one or more piles,
not necessarily of the same size. They then make moves in turn, starting
with Odd.
Odd\'s turn: Odd may choose any pile with an **odd** number of cookies,
eat one and divide the remaining (if any) into two equal piles.
Even\'s turn: Even may choose any pile with an **even** number of
cookies, eat two of them and divide the remaining (if any) into two
equal piles.
The player that does not have a valid move loses the game.

Let $C(N)$ be the number of ways that $N$ cookies can be divided so
that Even has a winning strategy.
For example, $C(5) = 2$ because there are two winning configurations
for Even: a single pile containing all five cookies; three piles
containing one, two and two cookies.
You are also given $C(16) = 64$.

Find $C(300)$.

Problem 860

Gary and Sally play a game using gold and silver coins arranged into a
number of vertical stacks, alternating turns. On Gary\'s turn he chooses
a gold coin and removes it from the game along with any other coins
sitting on top. Sally does the same on her turn by removing a silver
coin. The first player unable to make a move loses.

An arrangement is called [fair]{.dfn} if the person moving first,
whether it be Gary or Sally, will lose the game if both play optimally.

Define $F(n)$ to be the number of fair arrangements of $n$ stacks,

Problem 861
===========

A *unitary divisor* of a positive integer $n$ is a divisor $d$ of
$n$ such that $\gcd\left(d,\frac{n}{d}\right)=1$.

A *bi-unitary divisor* of $n$ is a divisor $d$ for which $1$ is
the only unitary divisor of $d$ that is also a unitary divisor of
$\frac{n}{d}$.

For example, $2$ is a bi-unitary divisor of $8$, because the unitary
divisors of $2$ are $\{1,2\}$, and the unitary divisors of $8/2$
are $\{1,4\}$, with $1$ being the only unitary divisor in common.

The bi-unitary divisors of $240$ are
$\{1,2,3,5,6,8,10,15,16,24,30,40,48,80,120,240\}$.

Let $P(n)$ be the product of all bi-unitary divisors of $n$. Define
$Q\_k(N)$ as the number of positive integers $1 \lt n \leq N$ such
that $P(n)=n^k$. For example, $Q\_2\left(10^2\right)=51$ and

Problem 862
===========

For a positive integer $n$ define $T(n)$ to be the number of
strictly larger integers which can be formed by permuting the digits of
$n$.

Leading zeros are not allowed and so for $n = 2302$ the total list of
permutations would be:

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
$2023,2032,2203,2230,\mathbf{2302},2320,3022,32 02,3220$

giving $T(2302)=4$.

Further define $S(k)$ to be the sum of $T(n)$ for all $k$-digit
numbers $n$. You are given $S(3) = 1701$.

Find $S(12)$.

Problem 863
===========

Using only a six-sided fair dice and a five-sided fair dice, we would
like to emulate an $n$-sided fair dice.

For example, one way to emulate a 28-sided dice is to follow this
procedure:

1.  Roll both dice, obtaining integers $1\le p\le 6$ and $1\le
    q\le 5$.
2.  Combine them using $r = 5(p-1) + q$ to obtain an integer $1\le
    r\le 30$.
3.  If $r\le 28$, return the value $r$ and stop.
4.  Otherwise ($r$ being 29 or 30), roll both dice again, obtaining
    integers $1\le s\le 6$ and $1\le t\le 5$.
5.  Compute $u = 30(r-29) + 5(s-1) + t$ to obtain an integer $1\le
    u\le 60$.
6.  If $u\>4$, return the value $((u-5)\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.
7.  Otherwise (with $1\le u\le 4$), roll the six-sided dice twice,
    obtaining integers $1\le v\le 6$ and $1\le w\le 6$.
8.  Compute $x = 36(u-1) + 6(v-1) + w$ to obtain an integer $1\le
    x\le 144$.
9.  If $x\>4$, return the value $((x-5)\bmod 28) + 1$ and stop.
10. Otherwise (with $1\le x\le 4$), assign $u:=x$ and go back to
    step 7.

The expected number of dice rolls in following this procedure is
2.142476 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Note that rolling both dice at
the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.

There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice
that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above
procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled
is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows
(D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,\...), truncated wherever the process stops. In
fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is
optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.

Different values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined
sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,\...) gives
an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333\... dice rolls on average.

Define $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal
procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and
a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence
of dice rolled is predetermined. So, $R(8) \approx 2.083333$ and
$R(28) \approx 2.142476$.

Let $S(n) = \displaystyle\sum\_{k=2}^n R(k)$. You are given that
$S(30) \approx 56.054622$.

Find $C(123567101113)$.

Problem 865
===========

A [triplicate number]{.dfn} is a positive integer such that, after
repeatedly removing three consecutive identical digits from it, all its
digits can be removed.

For example, the integer $122555211$ is a triplicate number:

1{\color{red}222}11\rightarrow{\color{red}111}\rightarrow.$$ On
the other hand, neither $663633$ nor $9990$ are triplicate numbers.

Let $T(n)$ be how many triplicate numbers are less than $10^n$.

For example, $T(6) = 261$ and $T(30) = 5576195181577716$.

Find $T(10^4)$. Give your answer modulo $998244353$.

Problem 866
===========

A small child has a "number caterpillar" consisting of $N$ jigsaw
pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a
line, reveal the numbers $1$ to $N$ in order.

Every night, the child\'s father has to pick up the pieces of the
caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up
the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.
As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments
that gradually merge together.

Any time the father places a new piece in its correct position, a
segment of length $k$ is formed and he writes down the $k$^th^
hexagonal number $k\cdot(2k-1)$. Once all pieces have been placed and
the full caterpillar constructed he calculates the product of all the
numbers written down. Interestingly, the expected value of this product
is always an integer. For example if $N=4$ then the expected value is
$994$.

Find the expected value of the product for a caterpillar of $N=100$
pieces. Give your answer modulo $987654319$.

Problem 868
===========

There is a method that is used by Bell ringers to generate all
variations of the order that bells are rung.

The same method can be used to create all permutations of a set of
letters. Consider the letters to be permuted initially in order from
smallest to largest. At each step swap the largest letter with the
letter on its left or right whichever generates a permutation that has
not yet been seen. If neither gives a new permutation then try the next
largest letter and so on. This procedure continues until all
permutations have been generated.

For example, $3$ swaps are required to reach the permutation CBA when
starting with ABC.
The swaps are ABC $\to$ ACB $\to$ CAB $\to$ CBA.
Also $59$ swaps are required to reach BELFRY when starting with these
letters in alphabetical order.

Find the number of swaps that are required to reach NOWPICKBELFRYMATHS
when starting with these letters in alphabetical order.

A prime is drawn uniformly from all primes not exceeding $N$. The

bit-by-bit starting at the least significant bit. The player scores one

the player is informed whether their guess was correct, and also whether
it was the last bit in the number - in which case the game is over.

Let $E(N)$ be the expected number of points assuming that the player
always guesses to maximize their score. For example, $E(10)=2$,
achievable by always guessing \"1\". You are also given $E(30)=2.9$.

Find $E(10^8)$. Give your answer rounded to eight digits after the

Two players play a game with a single pile of stones of initial size

\dots\}$.

A real number $q \gt 0$ is a *transition value* if $L(s)$ is
different from $L(t)$ for all $s \< q \< t$.

The sequence starts at $T\_1$, a tree with a single node as a root
with the number $1$.

For $n \> 1$, $T\_n$ is constructed from $T\_{n-1}$ using the
following procedure:

1.  Trace a path from the root of $T\_{n-1}$ to a leaf by following
    the largest-numbered child at each node.
2.  Remove all edges along the traced path, disconnecting all nodes
    along it from their parents.
3.  Connect all orphaned nodes directly to a new node numbered $n$,

Problem 876
===========

Starting with three numbers $a, b, c$, at each step do one of the
three operations:

-   change $a$ to $2(b + c) - a$;
-   change $b$ to $2(c + a) - b$;
-   change $c$ to $2(a + b) - c$;

Define $f(a, b, c)$ to be the minimum number of steps required for one
number to become zero. If this is not possible then $f(a, b, c)=0$.

For example, $f(6,10,35)=3$: $$(6,10,35) \to (6,10,-3) \to
(8,10,-3) \to (8,0,-3).$$ However, $f(6,10,36)=0$ as no series of
operations leads to a zero number.

Also define $F(a, b)=\sum\_{c=1}^\infty f(a,b,c)$. You are given
$F(6,10)=17$ and $F(36,100)=179$.

Problem 877
===========

We use $x\oplus y$ for the bitwise XOR of $x$ and $y$.
Define the [XOR-product]{.dfn} of $x$ and $y$, denoted by $x
\otimes y$, similar to a long multiplication in base $2$, except
that the intermediate results are XORed instead of the usual integer
addition.

For example, $7 \otimes 3 = 9$, or in base $2$, $111\_2 \otimes
11\_2 = 1001\_2$:

\begin{align\*} \phantom{\otimes 111} 111\_2 \\ \otimes

\oplus \phantom{11} 111\_2 \phantom{9} \\ \hline
\phantom{\otimes 11} 1001\_2 \\ \end{align\*}

We consider the equation:

\begin{align} (a \otimes a) \oplus (2 \otimes a \otimes b) \oplus
(b \otimes b) = 5 \end{align}

For example, $(a, b) = (3, 6)$ is a solution.

Let $X(N)$ be the XOR of the $b$ values for all solutions to this
equation satisfying $0 \le a \le b \le N$.
You are given $X(10)=5$.

Problem 879
===========

A touch-screen device can be unlocked with a \"password\" consisting of
a sequence of two or more distinct spots that the user selects from a
rectangular grid of spots on the screen. The user enters their sequence
by touching the first spot, then tracing a straight line segment to the
next spot, and so on until the end of the sequence. The user\'s finger
remains in contact with the screen throughout, and may only move in
straight line segments from spot to spot.

If the finger traces a straight line that passes over an intermediate
spot, then that is treated as two line segments with the intermediate
spot included in the password sequence. For example, on a $3\times 3$
grid labelled with digits $1$ to $9$ (shown below), tracing $1-9$
is interpreted as $1-5-9$.

Once a spot has been selected it disappears from the screen. Thereafter,
the spot may not be used as an endpoint of future line segments, and it
is ignored by any future line segments which happen to pass through it.
For example, tracing $1-9-3-7$ (which crosses the $5$ spot twice)
will give the password $1-5-9-6-3-7$.

$(x,y)$ is called a *nested radical pair* if $x$ and $y$ are
non-zero integers such that $\dfrac{x}{y}$ is not a cube of a
rational number, and there exist integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ such
that:

$$\sqrt{\sqrt\[3\]{x}+\sqrt\[3\]{y}}=\sqrt\[3\]{a}+\sqrt\[3\]{b}+\sqrt\[3\]{c}$$

For example, both $(-4,125)$ and $(5,5324)$ are nested radical
pairs:

$$ \begin{align\*} \begin{split}
\sqrt{\sqrt\[3\]{-4}+\sqrt\[3\]{125}} &=
\sqrt\[3\]{-1}+\sqrt\[3\]{2}+\sqrt\[3\]{4}\
\sqrt{\sqrt\[3\]{5}+\sqrt\[3\]{5324}} &=
\sqrt\[3\]{-2}+\sqrt\[3\]{20}+\sqrt\[3\]{25}\\ \end{split}
\end{align\*} $$

Let $H(N)$ be the sum of $\|x\|+\|y\|$ for all the nested radical
pairs $(x, y)$ where $\|x\| \leq \|y\|\leq N$.
For example, $H(10^3)=2535$.

Find $H(10^{15})$. Give your answer modulo $1031^3+2$.

Problem 881

vertices. An edge is drawn between two vertices $a \lt b$ if their
quotient $b/a$ is prime. The graph can be arranged into levels where
vertex $n$ is at level $0$ and vertices that are a distance $k$
from $n$ are on level $k$. Define $g(n)$ to be the maximum number

Problem 882
===========

Dr. One and Dr. Zero are playing the following partisan game.
The game begins with one $1$, two $2$\'s, three $3$\'s, \...,
$n$ $n$\'s. Starting with Dr. One, they make moves in turn.
Dr. One chooses a number and changes it by removing a $1$ from its
binary expansion.
Dr. Zero chooses a number and changes it by removing a $0$ from its
binary expansion.
The player that is unable to move loses.
Note that leading zeros are not allowed in any binary expansion; in
particular nobody can make a move on the number $0$.

They soon realize that Dr. Zero can never win the game. In order to make
it more interesting, Dr. Zero is allowed to \"skip the turn\" several
times, i.e. passing the turn back to Dr. One without making a move.

For example, when $n = 2$, Dr. Zero can win the game if allowed to
skip $2$ turns. A sample game: $$ \[1, 2,
2\]\xrightarrow{\textrm{Dr. One}}\[1, 0, 2\]\xrightarrow{\textrm{Dr.
Zero}}\[1, 0, 1\]\xrightarrow{\textrm{Dr. One}}\[1, 0,
0\]\xrightarrow\[\textrm{skip}\]{\textrm{Dr. Zero}} \[1, 0,
0\]\xrightarrow{\textrm{Dr. One}}\[0, 0,
0\]\xrightarrow\[\textrm{skip}\]{\textrm{Dr. Zero}}\[0, 0, 0\]. $$
Let $S(n)$ be the minimal number of skips needed so that Dr. Zero has
a winning strategy.
For example, $S(2) = 2$, $S(5) = 17$, $S(10) = 64$.

Find $S(10^5)$.

In this problem we consider triangles drawn on a **hexagonal lattice**,
where each lattice point in the plane has six neighbouring points
equally spaced around it, all distance $1$ away.

We call a triangle *remarkable* if

-   All three vertices and its **incentre** lie on lattice points
-   At least one of its angles is $60^\circ$

![0883\_diagram.png](resources/images/0883_diagram.png?1707941179)

Above are four examples of remarkable triangles, with $60^\circ$
angles illustrated in red. Triangles A and B have inradius $1$; C has
inradius $\sqrt{3}$; D has inradius $2$.

Define $T(r)$ to be the number of remarkable triangles with inradius
$\le r$. Rotations and reflections, such as triangles A and B above,
are counted separately; however direct translations are not. That is,
the same triangle drawn in different positions of the lattice is only
counted once.

Find $T(10^6)$.

Problem 884

Starting from a positive integer $n$, at each step we subtract from
$n$ the largest perfect cube not exceeding $n$, until $n$ becomes
$0$.
For example, with $n = 100$ the procedure ends in $4$ steps: $$100
\xrightarrow{-4^3} 36 \xrightarrow{-3^3} 9 \xrightarrow{-2^3} 1
\xrightarrow{-1^3} 0.$$ Let $D(n)$ denote the number of steps of
the procedure. Thus $D(100) = 4$.

Let $S(N)$ denote the sum of $D(n)$ for all positive integers $n$
**strictly less** than $N$.
For example, $S(100) = 512$.

A permutation of $\{2,3,\ldots,n\}$ is a rearrangement of these
numbers. A *coprime permutation* is a rearrangement such that all pairs
of adjacent numbers are coprime.

Let $P(n)$ be the number of coprime permutations of

For example, $P(4)=2$ as there are two coprime permutations,
$(2,3,4)$ and $(4,3,2)$. You are also given $P(10)=576$.

Consider the problem of determining a secret number from a set $\{1,
\..., N\}$ by repeatedly choosing a number $y$ and asking \"Is the
secret number greater than $y$?\".

If $N=1$ then no questions need to be asked. If $N=2$ then only one
question needs to be asked. If $N=64$ then six questions need to be
asked. However, in the latter case if the secret number is $1$ then
six questions still need to be asked. We want to restrict the number of
questions asked for small values.

Let $Q(N, d)$ be the least number of questions needed for a strategy
that can find any secret number from the set $\{1, \..., N\}$ where
no more than $x + d$ questions are needed to find the secret value
$x$.

It can be proved that $Q(N, 0) = N - 1$. You are also given $Q(7, 1)
= 3$ and $Q(777, 2) = 10$.

Find $\displaystyle \sum\_{d=0}^7 \sum\_{N=1}^{7^{10}} Q(N, d)$.

Problem 888

Two players play a game with a number of piles of stones, alternating
turns. Each turn a player can choose to remove 1, 2, 4, or 9 stones from
a single pile; or alternatively they can choose to split a pile
containing two or more stones into two non-empty piles. The winner is
the player who removes the last stone.

A collection of piles is called a losing position if the player to move
cannot force a win with optimal play. Define $S(N, m)$ to be the
number of distinct losing positions arising from $m$ piles of stones
where each pile contains from $1$ to $N$ stones. Two positions are
considered equivalent if they consist of the same pile sizes. That is,
the order of the piles does not matter.

You are given $S(12,4)=204$ and $S(124,9)=2259208528408$.

Recall the blancmange function from [Problem 226](problem=226): $T(x) =
\sum\limits\_{n = 0}^\infty\dfrac{s(2^nx)}{2^n}$, where $s(x)$
is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.

For positive integers $k, t, r$, we write $$F(k, t, r) = (2^{2k} -
1)T\left(\frac{(2^t + 1)^r}{2^k + 1}\right).$$ It can be shown
that $F(k, t, r)$ is always an integer.
For example, $F(3, 1, 1) = 42$, $F(13, 3, 3) = 23093880$ and
$F(103, 13, 6) \equiv 878922518\pmod {1\,000\,062\,031}$.

Problem 891

A round clock only has three hands: hour, minute, second. All hands look
identical and move continuously. Moreover, there is no number or
reference mark so that the \"upright position\" is unknown. The clock
functions the same as a normal 12-hour analogue clock.

Despite the inconvenient design, for most time it is possible to tell
the correct time (within a 12-hour cycle) from the clock, just by
measuring accurately the angles between the hands. For example, if all
three hands coincide, then the time must be 12:00:00.

Nevertheless, there are several moments where the clock shows an
ambiguous reading. For example, the following moment could be either
1:30:00 or 7:30:00 (with the clock rotated $180^\circ$). Thus both
1:30:00 and 7:30:00 are ambiguous moments.
Note that even if two hands perfectly coincide, we can still see them as
two distinct hands in the same position. Thus for example 3:00:00 and
9:00:00 are not ambiguous moments.

line segments, so that no two line segments intersect, including on
their end points. The $n$ line segments then cut the circle into $n +
1$ pieces. Each piece is painted either black or white, so that
adjacent pieces are opposite colours. Let $d(C)$ be the absolute

Problem 901

A driller drills for water. At each iteration the driller chooses a
depth $d$ (a positive real number), drills to this depth and then
checks if water was found. If so, the process terminates. Otherwise, a
new depth is chosen and a new drilling starts from the ground level in a
new location nearby.

Drilling to depth $d$ takes exactly $d$ hours. The groundwater depth
is constant in the relevant area and its distribution is known to be an
[exponential random
variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) with
expected value of $1$. In other words, the probability that the

Problem 902
===========

A permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ can be represented in
**one-line notation** as $\pi(1),\ldots,\pi(n) $. If all $n!$
permutations are written in lexicographic order then
$\textrm{rank}(\pi)$ is the position of $\pi$ in this 1-based
list.

For example, $\text{rank}(2,1,3) = 3$ because the six permutations of
$\{1, 2, 3\}$ in lexicographic order are: $$1, 2, 3\quad 1, 3, 2
\quad 2, 1, 3 \quad 2, 3, 1 \quad 3, 1, 2 \quad 3, 2, 1$$

For a positive integer $m$, we define the following permutation of
$\{1, \dots, n\}$ with $n = \frac{m(m+1)}2$: $$ \begin{align}
\sigma(i) &= \begin{cases} \frac{k(k-1)}2 + 1 & \textrm{if } i =
\frac{k(k + 1)}2\textrm{ for }k\in\{1, \dots, m\};\\i + 1 &
\textrm{otherwise};\end{cases}\\ \tau(i) &= ((10^9 + 7)i \bmod n)
+ 1\\ \pi(i) &= \tau^{-1}(\sigma(\tau(i))) \end{align} $$

\text{rank}(\pi^k)$.
For example, $P(2) = 4$, $P(3) = 780$ and $P(4) = 38810300$.

Find $P(100)$. Give your answer modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.

Problem 903
===========

A permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ can be represented in
**one-line notation** as $\pi(1),\ldots,\pi(n) $. If all $n!$
permutations are written in lexicographic order then
$\textrm{rank}(\pi)$ is the position of $\pi$ in this 1-based
list.

For example, $\text{rank}(2,1,3) = 3$ because the six permutations of
$\{1, 2, 3\}$ in lexicographic order are: $$1, 2, 3\quad 1, 3, 2
\quad 2, 1, 3 \quad 2, 3, 1 \quad 3, 1, 2 \quad 3, 2, 1$$

Let $Q(n)$ be the sum $\sum\_{\pi}\sum\_{i = 1}^{n!}
\text{rank}(\pi^i)$, where $\pi$ ranges over all permutations of
$\{1, \dots, n\}$.

For example, $Q(2) = 5$, $Q(3) = 88$, $Q(6) = 133103808$ and
$Q(10) \equiv 468421536 \pmod {10^9 + 7}$.

Find $Q(10^6)$. Give your answer modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.
